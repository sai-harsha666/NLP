0,"A History Of Paisley:

You who will find the dark fossils of paisleys one afternoon on the peaks of Zabarvan Trader from an ancient market of the future, alibi of chronology, that vain collaborator of time - won't know that these are her footprints from the day the world began.
(Oh see, it is still the day the world begins: and the city rises, holding its remains, its wooden beams already their own fire's prophets.)
And you, now touching sky, deaf to her anklets still echoing in the valley, deaf to men fleeing from soldiers into dead-end lanes
(Look! Their feet bleed; they leave footprints on the street which will give up its fabric, at dusk, a carpet) you have found-you'll think- the first teardrop, gem that was enticed for a mogul diadem into design...
...three men are discussing, between sips of tea, undiscovered routes on emerald seas, ships with almonds, with shawls for Egypt. It is dusk. The gauze is torn. A weaver kneels, gathers falling threads. Soon he will stitch the air.

A Pastoral

on the wall the dense ivy of executions --ZBIGNIEW HERBERT We shall meet again, in Srinagar, by the gates of the Villa of Peace, our hands blossoming into fists till the soldiers return the keys and disappear. Again we'll enter our last world, the first that vanished
in our absence from the broken city. We'll tear our shirts for tourniquets and bind the open thorns, warm the ivy into roses. Quick, by the pomegranate-- the bird will say--Humankind can bear everything. No need to stop the ear
to stories rumored in branches: We'll hear our gardener's voice, the way we did as children, clear under trees he'd planted:  It's true, my death, at the mosque entrance, in the massacre, when the Call to Prayer opened the floodgates --Quick, follow the silence--
 and dawn rushed into everyone's eyes.  Will we follow the horned lark, pry open the back gate into the poplar groves, go past the search post into the cemetery, the dust still uneasy on hurried graves with no names, like all new ones in the city?
 It's true  (we'll hear our gardener again).  That bird is silent all winter. Its voice returns in spring, a plaintive cry. That's when it saw the mountain falcon rip open, in mid-air, the blue magpie, then carry it, limp from the talons. 
Pluck the blood: My words will echo thus at sunset, by the ivy, but to what purpose?
In the drawer of the cedar stand, white in the verandah, we'll find letters: When the post offices died, the mailman knew we'd return to answer them. Better
if he'd let them speed to death, blacked out by Autumn's Press Trust not like this, taking away our breath, holding it with love's anonymous scripts:  See how your world has cracked. Why aren't you here? Where are you? Come back.
Is history deaf there, across the oceans?  Quick, the bird will say. And we'll try the keys, with the first one open the door into the drawing room. Mirror after mirror, textiled by dust, will blind us to our return as we light oil lamps. The glass map of our country,
still on the wall, will tear us to lace-- We'll go past our ancestors, up the staircase, holding their wills against our hearts. Their wish was we return--forever!--and inherit(Quick, the bird will say) that to which we belong, not like this-- to get news of our death after the world's.

Prayer Rug

Those intervals between the day's five calls to prayer
the women of the house pulling thick threads through vegetables
rosaries of ginger of rustling peppers in autumn drying for winter
in those intervals this rug part of Grandma's dowry folded
so the Devil's shadow would not desecrate Mecca scarlet-woven
with minarets of gold but then the sunset call to prayer
the servants their straw mats unrolled praying or in the garden
in summer on grass the children wanting the prayers to end
the women's foreheads touching Abraham's silk stone of sacrifice
black stone descended from Heaven the pilgrims in white circling it
this year my grandmother also a pilgrim in Mecca she weeps
as the stone is unveiled she weeps holding on to the pillars

Shaving

In the mirror, the hand hacks at my skin It belongs to the child who used his father's blades for sharpening pencils, playing murder.
Full of cuts, I have the blood-effacing instruments: water, water, and survival tricks : I'm as clean
as glass, my brown face glistens with oil, turns a fine olive green. There's no return
to the sanctuary of ripped paper-boat-journeys
This is morning, I must scrub myself. A college lecturer, I smell of talcum Old Spice and unwritten poems.
The mirror smiles back like a forgotten student:
The hairs die like ants in the basin.
My reflection gathers the night's dust, I wipe it with the morning towels.
The girls drape their muslin shawls, their necks turn on Isadora's wheels:
In the classroom I shuffle like unrhymed poetry
The blade, wet with Essenin's wrist, waits with the unwritten poem.

Snow on the Desert

Each ray of sunshine is seven minutes old,  Serge told me in New York one December night.
So when I look at the sky, I see the past?   Yes, Yes,' he said.  especially on a clear day. 
On January 19, 1987, as I very early in the morning drove my sister to Tucson International,
suddenly on Alvernon and 22nd Street the sliding doors of the fog were opened,
and the snow, which had fallen all night, now sun-dazzled, blinded us, the earth whitened
out, as if by cocaine, the desert's plants, its mineral-hard colors extinguished, wine frozen in the veins of the cactus.
***
The Desert Smells Like Rain: in it I read: The syrup from which sacred wine is made
is extracted from the saguaros each summer. The Papagos place it in jars,
where the last of it softens, then darkens into a color of blood though it tastes
strangely sweet, almost white, like a dry wine. As I tell Sameetah this, we are still
seven miles away.  And you know the flowers of the saguaros bloom only at night? 
We are driving slowly, the road is glass.  Imagine where we are was a sea once.
Just imagine!  The sky is relentlessly sapphire, and the past is happening quickly:
the saguaros have opened themselves, stretched out their arms to rays millions of years old,
in each ray a secret of the planet's origin, the rays hurting each cactus
into memory, a human memory for they are human, the Papagos say:
not only because they have arms and veins and secrets. But because they too are a tribe,
vulnerable to massacre.  It is like the end, perhaps the beginning of the world, 
Sameetah says, staring at their snow-sleeved arms. And we are driving by the ocean
that evaporated here, by its shores, the past now happening so quickly that each
stoplight hurts us into memory, the sky taking rapid notes on us as we turn
at Tucson Boulevard and drive into the airport, and I realize that the earth
is thawing from longing into longing and that we are being forgotten by those arms.
***
At the airport I stared after her plane till the window was
again a mirror. As I drove back to the foothills, the fog
shut its doors behind me on Alvernon, and I breathed the dried seas
the earth had lost, their forsaken shores. And I remembered
another moment that refers only to itself:
in New Delhi one night as Begum Akhtar sang, the lights went out.
It was perhaps during the Bangladesh War, perhaps there were sirens,
air-raid warnings. But the audience, hushed, did not stir.
The microphone was dead, but she went on singing, and her voice
was coming from far away, as if she had already died.
And just before the lights did flood her again, melting the frost
of her diamond into rays, it was, like this turning dark
of fog, a moment when only a lost sea can be heard, a time
to recollect every shadow, everything the earth was losing,
a time to think of everything the earth and I had lost, of all
that I would lose, of all that I was losing.

Snowmen

My ancestor, a man of Himalayan snow, came to Kashmir from Samarkand, carrying a bag of whale bones: heirlooms from sea funerals. His skeleton carved from glaciers, his breath arctic, he froze women in his embrace. His wife thawed into stony water, her old age a clear evaporation. This heirloom, his skeleton under my skin, passed from son to grandson, generations of snowmen on my back. They tap every year on my window, their voices hushed to ice. No, they won't let me out of winter, and I've promised myself, even if I'm the last snowman, that I'll ride into spring on their melting shoulders.

Storm

The rain dissolves its liquid bones Humming the wind, the lightning grazes the skin. A cloud descends : My eye is vapour, this, the dream's downpour: I must seal the tin-blue spaces.
I glued some scraps, made a paper boat: Balancing a prophet's journey, the Great Flood in the bathroom sink, I was six years old: Mother, close the tap, Noah has hit the night, his Ark will sink.
In the Atlantic's pariah-blue, there are no survivors; On the unsinkable Titanic, I'm left all alone; Ice-bergs hide their whale-teeth: I can't save Noah, God has picked his relic,
beaten me to it: He wears Noah, a charm round His neck. On the empty deck, no life-boat left, my fingers capsize. My jacket is ice, I hold on to its cold, to anything. Mother,
I'm alone, terribly alone.

Taxidermist

First the hand, delicate, precise, knows how to carve where to take the knife, make more alive than when alive:
No fur, no feather, I am only skin-deep, so easy to get to the cancer beneath:
He fills me with straw, Yeats's tattered coat at twenty-five, (not the adolescent fancy-dress-scarecrow when I won the first prize!)
No hurdle now, he reaches my hunger: I've never felt so full before!
I scare eagles, the stuffed crows in his room; they escape me, freedom a synonym for the sky.
Caressed by the leopard's vacant eye, finally warm, secure, in his skin, I turn towards the bloodless direction.
The fan drones in my veins, blood humming like chopped air; my tongue hangs out, poems dead in its corners.
Suave pimp of freedom, here I am, ready for your show-window: Will you now bargain for me?

The Wolf's Postcript To 'Little Red Riding Hood'

First, grant me my sense of history: I did it for posterity, for kindergarten teachers and a clear moral: Little girls shouldn't wander off in search of strange flowers, and they mustn't speak to strangers.
And then grant me my generous sense of plot: Couldn't I have gobbled her up right there in the jungle? Why did I ask her where her grandma lived? As if I, a forest-dweller, didn't know of the cottage under the three oak trees and the old woman lived there all alone? As if I couldn't have swallowed her years before?
And you may call me the Big Bad Wolf, now my only reputation. But I was no child-molester though you'll agree she was pretty.
And the huntsman: Was I sleeping while he snipped my thick black fur and filled me with garbage and stones? I ran with that weight and fell down, simply so children could laugh at the noise of the stones cutting through my belly, at the garbage spilling out with a perfect sense of timing, just when the tale should have come to an end.

After we died--That was it!--God left us in the dark. And as we forgot the dark, we forgot even the rain.
Drought was over. Where was I? Drinks were on the house. For mixers, my love, you'd poured--what?--even the rain.
Of this pear-shaped orange's perfumed twist, I will say: Extract Vermouth from the bergamot, even the rain.
How did the Enemy love you--with earth? air? and fire? He held just one thing back till he got even: the rain.
This is God's site for a new house of executions? You swear by the Bible, Despot, even the rain?

I See Chile In My Rearview Mirror

This dream of water-what does it harbor? I see Argentina and Paraguay under a curfew of glass, their colors breaking, like oil. The night in Uruguay
is black salt. I'm driving toward Utah, keeping the entire hemisphere in viewColombia vermilion, Brazil blue tar, some countries wiped clean of color: Peru
is titanium white. And always oceans that hide in mirrors: when beveled edges arrest tides or this world's destinations forsake ships. There's Sedona, Nogales
far behind. Once I went through a mirrorfrom there too the world, so intact, resembled only itself. When I returned I tore the skin off the glass. The sea was unsealed
by dark, and I saw ships sink off the coast of a wounded republic. Now from a blur of tanks in Santiago, a white horse gallops, riderless, chased by drunk soldiers
in a jeep; they're firing into the moon. And as I keep driving in the desert, someone is running to catch the last bus, men hanging on to its sides. And he's missed it.
He is running again; crescents of steel fall from the sky. And here the rocks are under fog, the cedars a temple, Sedona carved by the wind into gods-
each shadow their worshiper. The siren empties Santiago; he watches -from a hush of windows-blindfolded men blurred in gleaming vans. The horse vanishes
into a dream. I'm passing skeletal figures carved in 700 B.C. Whoever deciphers these canyon walls remains forsaken, alone with history,
no harbor for his dream. And what else will this mirror now reason, filled with water? I see Peru without rain, Brazil without forests-and here in Utah a dagger
of sunlight: it's splitting-it's the summer solstice-the quartz center of a spiral. Did the Anasazi know the darker answer also-given now in crystal
by the mirrored continent? The solstice, but of winter? A beam stabs the window, diamonds him, a funeral in his eyes. In the lit stadium of Santiago,
this is the shortest day. He's taken there. Those about to die are looking at him, his eyes the ledger of the disappeared. What will the mirror try now? I'm driving,
still north, always followed by that country, its floors ice, its citizens so lovesick that the ground-sheer glass-of every city is torn up. They demand the republic
give back, jeweled, their every reflection. They dig till dawn but find only corpses. He has returned to this dream for his bones. The waters darken. The continent vanishes.

Learning Urdu

From a district near Jammu, (Dogri stumbling through his Urdu) he comes, the victim of a continent broken in two in nineteen forty-seven. He mentions the minced air he ate while men dissolved in alphabets of blood, in syllables of death, of hate.
'I only remember half the word that was my village. The rest I forget. My memory belongs to the line of blood across which my friends dissolved into bitter stanzas of some dead poet.'
He wanted me to sympathize. I couldn't, I was only interested in the bitter couplets which I wanted him to explain. He continued,
'And I who knew Mir backwards, every couplet from the Diwan-e-Ghalib saw poetry dissolve into letters of blood.' He
Now remembers nothing while I find Ghalib at the crossroads of language, refusing to move to any side, masquerading as a beggar to see my theatre of kindness.

Lenox Hill

(In Lenox Hill Hospital, after surgery, my mother said the sirens sounded like the elephants of Mihiragula when his men drove them off cliffs in the Pir Panjal Range.) The Hun so loved the cry, one falling elephant's, he wished to hear it again. At dawn, my mother heard, in her hospital-dream of elephants, sirens wail through Manhattan like elephants forced off Pir Panjal's rock cliffs in Kashmir: the soldiers, so ruled, had rushed the elephant, The greatest of all footprints is the elephant's, said the Buddha. But not lifted from the universe, those prints vanished forever into the universe, though nomads still break news of those elephants as if it were just yesterday the air spread the dye ( War's annals will fade into night / Ere their story die ),
the punishing khaki whereby the world sees us die out, mourning you, O massacred elephants! Months later, in Amherst, she dreamt: She was, with diamonds, being stoned to death. I prayed: If she must die, let it only be some dream. But there were times, Mother, while you slept, that I prayed, 'Saints, let her die.' Not, I swear by you, that I wished you to die but to save you as you were, young, in song in Kashmir, and I, one festival, crowned Krishna by you, Kashmir listening to my flute. You never let gods die. Thus I swear, here and now, not to forgive the universe that would let me get used to a universe
without you. She, she alone, was the universe as she earned, like a galaxy, her right not to die, defying the Merciful of the Universe, Master of Disease,  in the circle of her traverse of drug-bound time. And where was the god of elephants, plump with Fate, when tusk to tusk, the universe, dyed green, became ivory? Then let the universe, like Paradise, be considered a tomb. Mother, they asked me, So how's the writing? I answered My mother
is my poem. What did they expect? For no verse sufficed except the promise, fading, of Kashmir and the cries that reached you from the cliffs of Kashmir
(across fifteen centuries) in the hospital. Kashmir, she's dying! How her breathing drowns out the universe as she sleeps in Amherst. Windows open on Kashmir: There, the fragile wood-shrines--so far away--of Kashmir! O Destroyer, let her return there, if just to die. Save the right she gave its earth to cover her, Kashmir has no rights. When the windows close on Kashmir, I see the blizzard-fall of ghost-elephants. I hold back--she couldn't bear it--one elephant's story: his return (in a country far from Kashmir) to the jungle where each year, on the day his mother died, he touches with his trunk the bones of his mother.
'As you sit here by me, you're just like my mother,' she tells me. I imagine her: a bride in Kashmir, she's watching, at the Regal, her first film with Father. If only I could gather you in my arms, Mother, I'd save you--now my daughter--from God. The universe opens its ledger. I write: How helpless was God's mother! Each page is turned to enter grief's accounts. Mother, I see a hand. Tell me it's not God's. Let it die. I see it. It's filling with diamonds. Please let it die. Are you somewhere alive, somewhere alive, Mother? Do you hear what I once held back: in one elephant's cry, by his mother's bones, the cries of those elephants
that stunned the abyss? Ivory blots out the elephants. I enter this: The Beloved leaves one behind to die. For compared to my grief for you, what are those of Kashmir, and what (I close the ledger) are the griefs of the universe when I remember you--beyond all accounting--O my mother?

My book's been burned? Send me the ashes, so I can say: I've been sent the phoenix in a coffin of light.

To swing yourself from moment to moment, to weave a clause that leaves room for reminiscence and surprise, that breathes, welcomes commas, dips and soars through air-pockets of vowel, lingers over the granularity of consonant, never racing to the full-stop, content sometimes with the question mark, even if it's the oldest one in the book.
To stand in the vast howling, rain-gouged openness of a page, asking the question that has been asked before, knowing the gale of a thousand libraries will whip it into the dark.

into a Cadbury's Five Star bar, Kanchenjanga, kisses bluer than the Adriatic, honeystain of sunlight

to pop a universe into one's mouth.
It's back again, the lust that is the deepest I have known,

Later we drank deep draughts of monsoon wind together, locked eyes in mistrust, littered our bedroom with books, fuzzy battle-lines, quivering dominions of love and malice, even as we ruptured time, scooping world upon world out of cavernous weekend afternoons through the alchemy of mutual dream turquoise summers over ruined Mycenae, the moon-watered stone of Egyptian temples, and those times we set the zephyr whispering under the black skies of Khorasan.
Clothes were never shared, diaries zealously guarded, but in the hour before the mind carves out its own fiefdoms of memory we dipped into the same dark estuaries of lust, grief and silted longing.
Now in rooms deodorised into neutrality, we sniff covertly for new secrets, new battles, new men, always careful to evade the sharp salinity of recollection, anything that could plunge us back to the roiling green swamp of our beginnings.
But tonight if I stood at my window it would take very little, or so it would seem, to swing myself across to that blazing pageant of peonies that is your Brooklyn back-garden, careening across continents on that long-vanished plait of hair, sleek with moonshine, fragrant with Atlantic breezes.

Teach me how to come of age in a literature you've bark-scratched into scripture. Smear my consonants with cow-dung and turmeric and godhuli. Pity me, sweating, rancid, on the other side of the counter. Stamp my papers, lease me a new anxiety, grant me a visa to the country of my birth. Teach me how to belong, the way you do, on every page of world history.

Tree

It takes a certain cussedness to be a tree in this city, a certain inflexible woodenness
to dig in your heels and hold your own amid lamp-posts sleek as mannequins and buildings that hold sun and glass together with more will-power than cement,
to continue that dated ritual, re-issuing a tireless maze of phalange and webbing, perpetuating that third world profusion of outstretched hand, each with its blaze of finger and more finger so many ways of tasting neon, so many ways of latticing a wind, so many ways of being ancillary to the self without resenting it.

Winter, Delhi, 1997

My grandparents in January on a garden swing discuss old friends from Rangoon, the parliamentary session, chrysanthemums, an electricity bill.
In the shadows, I eavesdrop, eighth grandchild, peripheral, half-forgotten, enveloped carelessly by the great winter shawl of their affection.
Our dissensions are ceremonial. I growl obligingly when he speaks of a Hindu nation, he waves a dismissive hand when I threaten romance with a Pakistani cricketer.
But there is more that connects us than speech ?avoured with the tartness of old curd that links me ?eetingly to her, and a blurry outline of nose that links me to him, and there is more that connects us than their daughter who birthed me.
I ask for no more. Irreplaceable, I belong here like I never will again, my credentials never in question, my tertiary nook in a gnarled family tree non-negotiable.
And we both know they will never need me as much as I, them. The inequality is comforting.

Confession

'To take a homeopathic approach to the soul is to deal with the darkness in ways that are in tune with the dark.'
---Thomas Moore It's taken time to realise no one survives. Not even the ordinary.
Time to own up then to blue throat and gall bladder extraordinaire,
to rages pristine, guilt unsmeared by mediocrity,
separation traumas subcontinental and griefs that dare to be primordial.
Time to iron out a face corrugated by perennial hope,
time to shrug off the harlotry and admit there's nothing hygienic about this darkness ­ no potted palms, no elevator music.
I erupt from pillars, half-lion half-woman.
The ?oor space index I demand is nothing short of epic.
I still wait sometimes for a ?icker of revelation but for the most part I'm unbribable.
When I open the coffee percolator the roof ?ies off.

Demand

And on days like this nothing else will do.
Nothing but that whisper of breath against the ear.
Breath that's warm like the sigh of palmyra trees in Tirunelveli plantations.
Breath that's crisp like linen, rice-starched, dhoop-soaked, in a family cupboard.
Breath to be trusted,
with a thread maybe of something your foremothers never knew, or pretended not to the spice-mist of hookah on winter nights in Isfahan, or raw splatter of Himalayan rain, or wine baroque with the sun of al-Andalus.
Breath of outsider, ancestor, friend,
who leaves nothing more than this signature of air against skin, reminding you
that there's nothing respectable about family linen when cupboard doors close,
reminding you that this this uncensored wilderness of greed is simply or not so simply -

Heirloom

My grandmother, wise even at eight, hid under her bed when her first suitor came home.
Grave and serene her features, defined as majestically as a head on an old coin, I realise through photographs, clouded by the silt of seasons, like the patina of age on Kanjeevaram silks, that in her day, girls of eight didn't have broken teeth or grazed elbows.
Now in her kitchen, she quietly stirs ancestral aromas of warm coconut lullabies, her voice tracing the familiar mosaic of family fables, chipped by repetition.
And yet, in the languorous swirl of sari, she carries the secret of a world where nayikas still walk with the liquid tread of those who know their bodies as well as they know their minds, still glide down deserted streets - to meet dark forbidden paramours whose eyes smoulder like lanterns in winter and return before sunset, the flowers in their hair radiating the perfume of an unrecorded language of romance.
The secret of a world that she refuses to bequeath with her recipes

I live on a road, a long magic road, full of beautiful people.
The women cultivate long mocha legs and the men sculpt their torsos right down to the designer curlicue of hair under each arm. The lure is the same: to confront self with self in this ancient city of mirrors that can bloat you into a centrespread, dismantle you into eyes, hair, teeth, butt, shrink you into a commercial break, explode you into 70 mm immortality.
But life on this road is about waiting ­ about austerities at the gym and the beauty parlour, about prayer outside the shrines of red-eyed producers, about PG digs waiting to balloon into penthouses, auto rickshaws into Ferraris, mice into chauffeurs.
Blessed by an epidemic of desperate hope, at any moment, my road might beanstalk to heaven.

Not scripture, no, but grant me the gasp of bridged synapse, the lightning alignment of marrow, mind and blood that allows words to spring
from the cusp of breathsong, from a place radiant with birdflight and rivergreen.
Not the certainty of stone, but grant me the quiet logic of rain, of love, of the simple calendars of my childhood of saints aureoled by overripe lemons.
Grant me the fierce tenderness of watching word slither into word, into the miraculous algae of language, untamed by doubt or gravity,
words careening, diving,
swarming, unforming, wilder than snowstorms in Antarctica, wetter than days in Cherrapunjee,
alighting on paper, only for a moment, tenuous, breathing, amphibious, before

May the shuttered windows keep the air as cool as bottled jasmine. May you never forget to listen to the crumpled whisper of sheets that mould themselves to your sleeping form. May the pillows always be silvered with cat-down and the muted percussion of a lover's breath. May the murmur of the wall clock continue to decree that your providence run ten minutes slow.

Who has the tigers and who the sheep never seems to make any difference. The result is always the same: She wins, I lose. But sometimes when her tigers are on the rampage, and I've lost half my herd of sheep, help comes from unexpected quarters: Above. The Rusty Shield Bearer, neutral till then, para-drops a winning flower -- yellow and irrelevant -- on the checkerboard drawn on the pavement in charcoal, cutting off the retreat of one tiger, and giving a check to the other;
and quickly follows it up with another flower -- just as yellow and just as irrelevant -- except that it comes down even more slowly; a flower without a search warrant that brushes past her earlobe, grazes her cheek, and disappears down the front of her low-cut blouse -- where she usually keeps her stash of hash -- to confuse her even further, with its mildly narcotic but very distracting fragrance.

Who was that, you ask. The eight-arm goddess, the priest replies. A sceptic match coughs. You can count. But she has eighteen, you protest. All the same she is still an eight-arm goddess to the priest.

Of course he's only a second class god and his place is just outside the main temple. Outside even of the outer wall. As if he belonged among the tradesmen and the lepers. I've known gods prettier faced or straighter laced. Gods who soak you for your gold. Gods who soak you for your soul. Gods who make you walk on a bed of burning coal. Gods who put a child inside your wife. Or a knife inside your enemy. Gods who tell you how to live your life, double your money or triple your land holdings. Gods who can barely suppress a smile as you crawl a mile for them. Gods who will see you drown if you won't buy them a new crown. And although I'm sure they're all to be praised, they're either too symmetrical or too theatrical for my taste. Yeshwant Rao, mass of basalt, bright as any post box, the shape of protoplasm or king size lava pie thrown against the wall, without an arm, a leg or even a single head. Yeshwant Rao.
He's the god you've got to meet. If you're short of a limb, Yeshwant Rao will lend you a hand and get you back on your feet. Yeshwant Rao Does nothing spectacular. He doesn't promise you the earth Or book your seat on the next rocket to heaven. But if any bones are broken, you know he'll mend them. He'll make you whole in your body and hope your spirit will look after itself. He is merely a kind of a bone-setter. The only thing is, as he himself has no heads, hands and feet, he happens to understand you a little better.

Pi-Dog

This is the time of day I like best, and this the hour when I can call this city my own;
when I like nothing better than to lie down here, at the exact centre of this traf?c island
(or trisland as I call it for short, and also to suggest a triangular island with rounded corners)
that doubles as a parking lot on working days, a corral for more than ?fty cars,
when it's deserted early in the morning, and I'm the only sign of intelligent life on the planet;
the concrete surface hard, ?at and cool against my belly, my lower jaw at rest on crossed forepaws;
just about where the equestrian statue of what's-his-name must've stood once, or so I imagine.
I look a bit like a seventeenth-century map of Bombay with its seven islands
not joined yet, shown in solid black on a body the colour of old parchment;
with Old Woman's Island
on my forehead, Mahim on my croup,
and the others distributed casually among brisket, withers, saddle and loin
- with a pirate's rather than a cartographer's regard for accuracy.
3 I like to trace my descent - no proof of course, just a strong family tradition -
matrilineally, to the only bitch that proved tough enough to have survived,
?rst, the long voyage, and then the wretched weather here - a combination
that killed the rest of the pack of thirty foxhounds, imported all the way from England
by Sir Bartle Frere in eighteen hundred and sixty-four, with the crazy idea
of introducing fox-hunting to Bombay. Just the sort of thing he felt the city badly needed.
4 On my father's side the line goes back to the dog that followed Yudhishthira
on his last journey,and stayed with him till the very end; long after all the others
- Draupadi ?rst, then Sahadeva, then Nakul, followed by Arjuna and, last of all, Bhima -
had fallen by the wayside. Dog in tow, Yudhishthira alone plodded on. Until he too,
frostbitten and blinded with snow, dizzy with hunger and gasping for air, was about to collapse
in the icy wastes of the Himalayas; when help came in the shape of a ?ying chariot
to airlift him to heaven. Yudhishthira, that noble prince, refused to get on board unless dogs were allowed.
And my ancestor became the only dog to have made it to heaven in recorded history.
5 To ?nd a more moving instance of man's devotion to dog, we have to leave the realm of history,
skip a few thousand years and pick up a work of science fantasy - Harlan Ellison's A Boy and his Dog,
a cultbook among pi-dogs everywhere in which the `Boy' of the title sacri?ces his love,
and serves up his girlfriend as dogfood to save the life of his starving canine master.
I answer to the name of Ugh. No, not the exclamation of disgust;
but the U pronounced as in Upanishad, and gh not silent, but as in ghost, ghoul or gherkin.
It's short for Ughekalikadu, Siddharamayya's famous dog that I was named after,
the guru of Kallidevayya's dog who could recite the four Vedas backwards.
My own knowledge of the scriptures begins and ends, I'm afraid,
with just one mantra, or verse; the tenth, from the sixty-second hymn
in the third mandala of the Rig (and to think that the Rig alone contains ten thousand
?ve hundred and ?fty-two verses). It's composed in the Gayatri metre, and it goes:
Om tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yonah prachodayat.
Twenty-four syllables, exactly, if you count the initial Om. Please don't ask me what it means, though.
All I know is that it's addressed to the sun-god - hence it's called Savitri -
and it seems appropriate enough to recite it as I sit here waiting for the sun
to rise. May the sun-god amplify the powers of my mind.
What I like about this time and place - as I lie here hugging the ground, my jaw at rest on crossed forepaws,
my eyes level with the welltempered but gaptoothed keyboard of the black-and-white concrete blocks
that form the border of this trisland and give me my primary horizon is that I am left completely undisturbed
to work in peace on my magnum opus: a triple sonata for a circumpiano based on three distinct themes -
one suggested by a magpie robin, another by the wail of an ambulance, and the third by a rockdrill;
a piebald pianist, caressing and tickling the concrete keys with his eyes, undeterred by digital deprivation.
As I play, the city slowly reconstructs itself, stone by numbered stone.
Every stone seeks out his brothers and is joined by his neighbours.
Every single crack returns to its ?agstone and all is forgiven.
Trees arrive at themselves, each one ready to give an account of its leaves.
The mahogany drops a casket bursting with winged seeds by the wayside,
like an inexperienced thief drops stolen jewels at the sight of a cop.
St Andrew's church tiptoes back to its place, shoes in hand, like a husband after late-night revels.
The university, you'll be glad to know, can never get lost
because, although forgetful, it always carries its address in its pocket.
My nose quivers. A many-coloured smell of innocence and lavender,
mildly acidic perspiration and nail polish, rosewood and rosin
travels like a lighted fuse up my nose and explodes in my brain.
It's not the leggy young girl taking a short cut through this island as usual,
violin case in hand, and late again for her music class at the Max Mueller Bhavan,
so much as a warning to me that my idyll will soon be over,
that the time has come for me to surrender the city to its so-called masters.

At eight I'm a Boy Scout and make a tent By stretching a bedsheet over parallel bars And a fire by burning rose bushes, I know half a dozen knots and drink Tea from enamel mugs. I wear khaki drill shorts, note down The number-plates of cars, Make a perfect about-turn for the first time.

I call out to the raven, &quot;My harem, my black rose The clock's slave, keeper of no man's land between us&quot; And the raven, a tear hung above his massive pupil, Covers my long hair with petals. Only once did I twist the monotonous pendulum To enter the rituals at the bottom of twelve seas Unghostlike voices curdled my blood, the colour Of my scorpion changed from scarlet To scarlet; I didn't mean to threaten you Or disturb your peace I know nothing of But you - living in these fables, branches And somehow icebergs - tell me, whose seed I carry.

To An Unborn Daughter

If writing a poem could bring you Into existence, I'd write one now, Filling the stanzas with more Skin and tissue than a body needs, Filling the lines with speech. I'd even give you your mother's
Close-bitten nails and light-brown eyes, For I think she had them. I saw her Only once, through a train window, In a yellow field. She was wearing A pale-coloured dress. It was cold. I think she wanted to say something.

Two Lakes

Lakes do not happen Only in geography. I know one with a Japanese garden And a limited zoo; it is surrounded By a red road and is completely Artificial. Among its reflections Are isolated trucks, fragrant locomotives, and a giant Steel works.
The second lake lies At the foot of a hill and is clean To the point of invisibility. On one side Is the club where dead Englishmen sit Down on tigers and play bridge; little Balls of air drift through their moustached faces. In the billiard-room the table is still Intact, while the stained kitchen-knife Has appeared in the region's Folklore.

In Madurai, city of temples and poets, who sang of cities and temples, every summer a river dries to a trickle in the sand, baring the sand ribs, straw and women's hair clogging the watergates at the rusty bars under the bridges with patches of repair all over them the wet stones glistening like sleepy crocodiles, the dry ones shaven water-buffaloes lounging in the sun The poets only sang of the floods.
He was there for a day when they had the floods. People everywhere talked of the inches rising, of the precise number of cobbled steps run over by the water, rising on the bathing places, and the way it carried off three village houses, one pregnant woman and a couple of cows named Gopi and Brinda as usual.
The new poets still quoted the old poets, but no one spoke in verse of the pregnant woman drowned, with perhaps twins in her, kicking at blank walls even before birth.
He said: the river has water enough
to be poetic about only once a year and then it carries away in the first half-hour three village houses, a couple of cows named Gopi and Brinda and one pregnant woman expecting identical twins with no moles on their bodies, with different coloured diapers to tell them apart.

squinting at the parallax of black planets, his Tiger, his Hare
moving in Sanskrit zodiacs, forever troubled by the fractions, the kidneys

I
Now tidy your house, dust especially your living room and do not forget to name all your children.
II
Watch your step. Sight may strike you blind in unexpected places.
The traffic light turns orange on 57th and Dorchester, and you stumble,
you fall into a vision of forest fires, enter a frothing Himalayan river,
rapid, silent.
On the 14th floor, Lake Michigan crawls and crawls
in the window. Your thumbnail cracks a lobster louse on the windowpane
from your daughter's hair and you drown, eyes open,
towards the Indies, the antipodes. And you, always so perfectly sane.
III
Now you know what you always knew: the country cannot be reached
by jet. Nor by boat on jungle river, hashish behind the Monkey-temple,
nor moonshot to the cratered Sea of Tranquillity, slim circus girls
on a tightrope between tree and tree with white parasols, or the one
and only blue guitar.
Nor by any other means of transport,
migrating with a clean valid passport, no, not even by transmigrating
without any passport at all, but only by answering ordinary
black telephones, questions walls and small children ask,
and answering all calls of nature.
IV
Watch your step, watch it, I say, especially at the first high threshold,
and the sudden low one near the end of the flight of stairs,
and watch for the last step that's never there.

Elements Of Composition

Composed as I am, like others, of elements on certain well-known lists, father's seed and mother's egg
gathering earth, air, fire, mostly water, into a mulberry mass, moulding calcium,
carbon, even gold, magnesium and such, into a chattering self tangled in love and work,
scary dreams, capable of eyes that can see, only by moving constantly, the constancy of things
like Stonehenge or cherry trees;
add uncle's eleven fingers making shadow-plays of rajas and cats, hissing,
becoming fingers again, the look of panic on sister's face an hour before
her wedding, a dated newspaper map, of a place one has never seen, maybe no longer there
after the riots, downtown Nairobi, that a friend carried in his passport as others would
a woman's picture in their wallets;
add the lepers of Madurai, male, female, married, with children,
lion faces, crabs for claws, clotted on their shadows under the stone-eyed
goddesses of dance, mere pillars, moving as nothing on earth can move &mdash
I pass through them as they pass through me taking and leaving
affections, seeds, skeletons,
millennia of fossil records of insects that do not last a day,
body-prints of mayflies, a legend half-heard in a train
of the half-man searching for an ever-fleeing other half
through Muharram tigers, hyacinths in crocodile waters, and the sweet
twisted lives of epileptic saints,
and even as I add I lose, decompose, into my elements
into other names and forms, past, and passing, tenses without time,

Prayers To Lord Murugan

Lord of new arrivals lovers and rivals: arrive at once with cockfight and banner-- dance till on this and the next three hills
women's hands and the garlands on the chests of men will turn like chariotwheels
O where are the cockscombs and where the beaks glinting with new knives at crossroads
when will orange banners burn among blue trumpet flowers and the shade of trees
waiting for lightnings?
Twelve etched arrowheads for eyes and six unforeseen faces, and you were not embarrassed.
Unlike other gods you find work for every face, and made eyes at only one woman. And your arms are like faces with proper names.
Lord of green growing things, give us a hand
in our fight with the fruit fly. Tell us,
will the red flower ever come to the branches of the blueprint
city?
Lord of great changes and small cells: exchange our painted grey pottery
for iron copper the leap of stone horses our yellow grass and lily seed for rams!
flesh and scarlet rice for the carnivals on rivers O dawn of nightmare virgins bring us
your white-haired witches who wear three colours even in sleep.
Lord of the spoor of the tigress, outside our town hyenas and civet cats live on the kills of leopards and tigers
too weak to finish what's begun.
Rajahs stand in photographs over ninefoot silken tigresses that sycophants have shot. Sleeping under country fans
hearts are worm cans turning over continually for the great shadows of fish in the open waters.
We eat legends and leavings, remember the ivory, the apes, the peacocks we sent in the Bible to Solomon, the medicines for smallpox, the similes
for muslin: wavering snakeskins, a cloud of steam Ever-rehearsing astronauts, we purify and return our urine to the circling body and burn our faeces for fuel to reach the moon through the sky behind the navel.
Master of red bloodstains, our blood is brown; our collars white.
Other lives and sixtyfour rumoured arts tingle,
pins and needles at amputees' fingertips in phantom muscle
Lord of the twelve right hands why are we your mirror men with the two left hands
capable only of casting reflections? Lord of faces,
find us the face we lost early this morning.
Lord of headlines, help us read the small print.
Lord of the sixth sense, give us back our five senses.
Lord of solutions, teach us to dissolve and not to drown.
Deliver us O presence from proxies and absences
from sanskrit and the mythologies of night and the several roundtable mornings
of London and return the future to what it was.
Lord, return us. Brings us back to a litter
of six new pigs in a slum and a sudden quarter of harvest
Lord of the last-born give us birth.
Lord of lost travellers, find us. Hunt us down.
Lord of answers, cure us at once of prayers.

Lost Images

(For Ashay) I am backing home where you died. One year later, to find Changes that mask our surrender To the inevitability of life. I remember my Ambulance Ride With my friend whom you called Daddy. It took me a whole year To understand my loss. A lifetime is not enough To realize what it means to be human: We waste what we are given To crave for what we cannot have. This much I know by now As a maker of images: A face erased in front Of the mirror that is our Lord. Vithoba was seen by Tukaram Reflected in the deep end, Where the river was its own source And the ocean that waits for it. Perhaps when you struggled for breath As you finally choked to death, You tried to forgive your parent And the world he created with you. And so, finally, you grew Up to surpass your father-Becoming a reflected sky In the water we call life. The first picture I took of you In the Princess Tsehai Hospital-In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia In the last week of June, 1961: Sister Aiyyalij held you in her arms; And her hand was on your covered breast. It showed the finger on her ring As large as your closed eyes. Your struggle for a breath Began before you were born,
And on December 4, 1984 In Bhopal it all came back. You struggled for breath all your life, Fighting for life, and looking for its sign-An autograph of awareness, The reassurance of your own being. You don't know that you've left behind Images that tell, images that haunt, Images in which others will find The reflection that fills God's mirror. Where the Lord Himself twists and turns In agony that's the other side of bliss. His reverse is us, his children, A family that He craves to own. And, in the end, there's no loss, And there's no gain either We neither live nor die In the endless space of why.

You go out of me in a pure spiral of stars A funeral progressing towards the end of time Innumerable petals of flame undress your dark Continuous stem of growing
I walk out of murders and riots I fall out of smouldering biographies I sleep on a bed of burning languages Sending you up in your essential fire and smoke Piece by piece at my own feet I fall Diamonds storm out of a black piano
Once I promised you an epic And now you have robbed me You have reduced me to rubble This concerto ends.

Prophets

Prophets have light Screwed tight in their eyes. They cannot see the darkness Inside their own loincloth. Their speech has grace And their voice tenderness. When prophets arrive Dogs do not bark. They only wag their tails Like newspaper reporters. Their tongues hang out And drool as profusely As editorials. Crowds in the street Split up like watermelons When prophets arrive.
But there are times when even the fuse of heavenly stars is blown Space boils like a forgotten kettle The screw comes off from the eyes And the blinded prophet is stunned It is then that he comprehends the spiral staircase of heaven made of iron The complexity of its architecture.
It is the first time that he apprehends God's inhuman boredom And the size of His shoes. The weight of His foot. And the total monopoly reflected In His every movement. It is then that he realises that His journey so far is only The space and time of His almighty yawn.

The View From Chinchpokli

A fouled Sun rises from behind the textile mills As I crawl out of my nightmares and hobble To the sink. Then I luxuriate in the toilet While my unprivileged compatriots of Parel Road Cross Lane Defecate along the stone wall of Byculla Goods Depot. I shudder at the thought of going out of this lane Towards the main road. Hundreds of workers are already returning From the night-shift, crossing the railway lines. The bus stop is already crowded. I begin to read The morning's papers and cover my naked mind With global events. The ceiling fan whirs, but I sweat. I breathe in the sulphur dioxide emitted By the Bombay Gas Company, blended with specks of cotton And carbon particles discharged by the mills That clothe millions of loins. Then I shave and shower, Dismissing all untouchables from my mind, fearing More palpable pollution. On my way out I shall throw a used condom and a crumpled pack of cigarettes Into the garbage. And like a glorious Hindu hero, Reluctantly riding his chariot to the centre of the battlefield, I will take a cab to the Manhattan-like Unreality of Nariman Point. There I will shape India's destiny Using my immaculate gift. I will ride in a taxi. I will pass the Victoria Gardens Zoo without blinking. Byculla Bridge will give me the first line of a poem, And the Christians, Jews, and Muslims on my way Will inspire a brilliant critique of contemporary Indian culture. Of course, I will ignore The junk-shops, the tea-houses, the restaurants, the markets I zig-zag through. I shall smoothly go past The Institute of Art, Anjuman-e-Islam, The Times of India, The Bombay Municipal Corporation, and Victoria Terminus. If I glance at Flora Fountain or the Bombay High Court, It will be an absent-minded observation And if I seem to look at the University of Bombay's Clock-tower and buildings it will only be the sulking Stare of a dirty-minded alma mater-fucker at the old hag herself. But beyond all lies my daily sigh of relief Because the gross millions are temporarily out of sight.
Some culture is possible in that half a square mile Where the wall of India cracks open and the sea is visible. At Chinchpokli, once I return in the evening, I plot seductions and rapes, plan masterpieces Of evasion. The loudspeakers blare at me. Bedbugs bite me. Cockroaches hover about my soul. Mice scurry around my metaphysics, mosquitoes sing among my lyrics Lizards crawl over my religion, spiders infest my politics. I itch. I become horny. I booze. I want to get smashed. And I do. It comes easy at Chinchpokli, Where, like a minor Hindu god, I am stoned By the misery of my worshippers and by my own Triumphant impotence.

His eyes dimmed by age fade homeward through the humid monsoon night. Now I can see him getting off the train Like a word dropped from a long sentence. He hurries across the length of the grey platform, Crosses the railway line, enters the lane, His chappals are sticky with mud, but he hurries onward. Home again, I see him drinking weak tea, Eating a stale chapati, reading a book. He goes into the toilet to contemplate Man's estrangement from a man-made world. Coming out he trembles at the sink, The cold water running over his brown hands, A few droplets cling to the greying hairs on his wrists. His sullen children have often refused to share Jokes and secrets with him. He will now go to sleep Listening to the static on the radio, dreaming Of his ancestors and grandchildren, thinking Of nomads entering a subcontinent through a narrow pass.

Gouge eyeballs out, hammer nails into the ear. When you have ravished all, missing No entrail, do not forget To return where you started: with a penknife Strike at the rising sparrow's neck; With ends of twine strangle the orbs That feed him seed; And outrage the sparrow's nest.

Public Hospital

How soon I've acquired it all! It would seem an age of hesitant gestures Awaited only this sententious month. Autocratic poise comes natural now: Voice sharp, glance impatient, A busy man's look of harried preoccupation Not embarrassed to appear so. My fingers deft to manoeuvre bodies, Pull down clothing, strip the soul. Give sorrow ear upto a point, Then snub it shut. Separate essential from suspect tales. Weed out malingerers, accept With patronage a steady stream Of the underfed, pack flesh in them, Then pack them away.
Almost, I tell myself, I embrace the people: Revel in variety of eye, colour, cheek, bone; Unwelcome guest, I may visit bodies, Touch close, cure, throw overboard Necessities of distance, plunge, Splice, violate,
With needle, knife, and tongue, Wreck all my bonds in them.
At end of day, From under the flagpole, Watch the city streaming By the side of my hands.

Squirrels In Washington

Squirrels in Washington come Galloping at you in fours, then brake To halt a few feet away And beg on hindquarters. No one stones them, And their fear is diminished. They do halt, even so, Some feet away, those few feet The object of my wonder. Do I Emit currents At closer quarters? Are those The few feet I would keep From a tame tiger? Is there A hierarchy, then, of distances, That must be observed, And non-observance would at once Agglutinate all of Nature Into a messy, inextricable mass? Ah Daphne! Passing From woman to foliage did she for a moment Sense all vegetable sap as current Of her own bloodstream, the green Flooding into the red? And when She achieved her final arboreal being, Shed dewy tears each dawn For that lost fleeting moment, That hint at freedom, In transit, between cage and cage?

From Bombay Central

The Saurashtra Express waits to start Chained patiently to the platform, Good pet, while I clamber in To take my reserved window seat And settle into the half-empty compartment's Cool; the odour of human manure Vague and sharp drifts in From adjoining platforms. The station's population of porters, Stall-keepers, toughs and vagabonds relieve themselves Ticketless, into the bowels of these waiting pets; Gujarat Mail, Delhi Janata, Bulsar Express, Quiet linear beasts, Offering unguarded toilets to a wave Of non-passengers, Bombay Central's In-residence population.
That odour does not offend. The station's high and cool vault Sucks it up and sprays down instead, Interspersed with miraculous, heraldic Shafts of sunlight, an eternal Station odour, amalgam Of diesel oil, hot steel, cool rails, Light and shadow, human sweat, Metallic distillations, dung, urine, Newspaper ink, Parle's Gluco Biscuits, And sharp noisy sprays of water from taps With worn-out bushes, all Hitting the nostril as one singular Invariable atmospheric thing, Seeping into your clothing The way cigarette smoke and air-conditioning Seep into you at cinema halls. I sink back into my hard wooden Third-class seat, buffered by This odour, as by a divine cushion. And do not suspect that this ride Will be for me the beginning of a meditation
On the nature of truth and beauty.

On Killing A Tree

It takes much time to kill a tree,
Not a simple jab of the knife
Will do it. It has grown Slowly consuming the earth, Rising out of it, feeding Upon its crust, absorbing Years of sunlight, air, water, And out of its leperous hide Sprouting leaves.
So hack and chop But this alone wont do it. Not so much pain will do it. The bleeding bark will heal And from close to the ground Will rise curled green twigs, Miniature boughs Which if unchecked will expand again To former size.
No, The root is to be pulled out Out of the anchoring earth; It is to be roped, tied, And pulled out - snapped out Or pulled out entirely, Out from the earth-cave, And the strength of the tree exposed, The source, white and wet, The most sensitive, hidden For years inside the earth.
Then the matter Of scorching and choking In sun and air, Browning, hardening, Twisting, withering,
And then it is done.

For days, months, years, Africa was our mulberry bush.

The pygmies came out of the Denkali forest At night With their poison-tipped arrows But there was always Phantom, With his skull ring And we woke up without sweat.
Every morning we returned before breakfast to Africa Turning brown among silver fish in the sunlight from the window.

On the dark long white patrolled streets of Africa.

This is hard brown laterite that I turn, to plant a few bright periwinkles stolen from the mound of one long obscure, dead. They should grow well here. So I turn out the millipedes curling up ashamed of the sudden expose into dark ring stones of sapphire and topaz. Pinned to sudden light they have all coiled up in abject surrender. These things we bury back with pushed up soil, crushing strange roots going everywhere like soft nerve fibers, sending messages of thirst to strange destinations. Each scoop of mud

Of late he painted his house bright chrysanthemum red ordered teakwood beds and never cared a damn what the neighbours said. Atop his showroom the great catlights came on and his name glowed in the dark whenever passing lights hit it.
Now he's not wondering any more, he knows he's the best in town.
What about air-conditioning? That would lengthen the life of coffins. Now he's struck with a bright new idea that would revolutionise coffin making for all time. Electronic remote-controlled polymer coffins with micro chips and inbuilt flash units that brought home to your PC screen your dear dear dear departed along with uptodate information on the state of decomposition that you could activate or slow down much like a video-game. An idea he knew would catch on like wild fire making him a billionaire overnight.
Now whenever he kneels down with Angela to pray, he can only think of this no one else can help him raise such funds so hi-tech which of course secretly meant more and more accidents, causalities, fatalities of course work was worship, it didn't matter what you did you just had to put in your best, there could be no wrong asking and for all this (if his dream came true)

The yellowed diary's notes whisper in vernacular. They sound the forgotten posture, the cramped cry that forces me to hear that voice. Now I stumble back in your black-paged wake.
No uneasy stir of cloud darkened the white skies of your day; the silence of dust grazed in the long afterniin sun, ruling the cracked fallow earth, ate into the laughter of your flesh.
For you it was the hardest question of all. Dead, empty tress stood by the dragging river, past your weakened body, flailing against your sleep. You thought of the way the jackals moved, to move.
Did you hear the young tamarind leaves rustle in the cold mean nights of your belly? Did you see your own death? Watch it tear at your cries, break them into fits of unnatural laughter?
How old were you? Hunted, you turned coward and ran, the real animal in you plunigng through your bone. You left your family behind, the buried things, the precious clod that praised the quality of a god.
The impersihable that swung your broken body, turned it inside out? What did faith matter? What Hindu world so ancient and true for you to hold? Uneasily you dreamed toward the center of your web.
The separate life let you survive, while perhaps the one you left wept in the blur of your heart. Now in a night of sleep and taunting rain My son and I speak of that famine nameless as snow.
A conscience of years is between us. He is young. The whirls of glory are breaking down for him before me. Does he think of the past as a loss we have lived, our own? Out of silence we look back now at what we do not know.
There is a dawn waiting beside us, whose signs are a hundred odd years away from you, Grandfather. You are an invisible piece on a board Whose move has made our children grow, to know us,
carrying us deep where our voices lapse into silence. We wish we knew you more. We wish we knew what it was to be, against dying, to know the dignity
that had to be earned dangerously, your last chance that was blindly terrifying, so unfair. We wish we had not to wake up with our smiles in the middle of some social order.

In the flickering dark his lean-to opened like a wound. The wind was I, and the days and nights before. Palm fronds scratched my skin. Inside the shack an oil lamp splayed the hours bunched to those walls. Over and over the sticky soot crossed the space of my mind.
I heard him say: My daughter, she's just turned fifteen... Feel her. I'll be back soon, your bus leaves at nine. The sky fell on me, and a father's exhausted wile.

And yet, down the steps into the water at Varanasi, where the lifeless bodies seem to grow human, the shaggy heads of word-buds move back and forth between the harsh castanets of the rain and the noiseless feathers of summer aware that their syllables' overwhelming silence would not escape the hearers now, and which must remain that mysterious divine path guarded by drifts of queer, quivering banyans: a language of clogs over cobbles, casting its uncertain spell, trembling sadly into mist.

Sickles

Dust seems in no hurry now, sailing the air. A ten-year-old girl runs after her home-bound cows through the ingenious sunset hour, glancing briefly as we pass by but gives no sign that she has seen us.
The day's last light surprises us, leaving everyone suddenly on an endless, desolate shore. And a small desire to make love then. Women returning home from fields of ripe grain carry sickles in their tired hands. The cut paddies cling to their quiet perches.
How little I understand myself, among children who are mothers already before the floods come, wetting the reeds on the shore; among women desired, even as we are indifferent to happenings by which they are possessed.
How the sickles shimmer with the reds of sunset hidden in the twilight of their veins

A Rain Of Rites

Sometims a rain comes slowly across the sky, that turns upon its grey cloud, breaking away into light before it reaches its objective.
The rain I have known and traded all this life is thrown like kelp on the beach. Like some shape of conscience I cannot look at, a malignant purpose is a nun's eye.
Who was the last man on earth, to whom the cold cloud brought the blood to his face?[?] Numbly I climb to the mountain-tops of ours where my own soul quivers on the edge of answers.
Which still, stale air sits on an angel's wings? What holds my rain so it's hard to overcome?

The Captive Air Of Chandipur-On-Sea

Day after day the drunk sea at Chandipur spits out the gauze wings of shells along the beach and rumples the thin air behind the sands. Who can tell of the songs of this sea that go on to baffle and double the space around our lives? Or of smells paralysed through the centuries, of deltas hard and white that stretched once to lure the feet of women bidding their men goodbye? Or of salt and light that dark and provocative eyes demanded, their shoulders drooping like lotuses in the noonday sun?
And what is it now that scatters the tide in the shadow of this proud watercourse? The ridicule of the dead? Sussurant sails still whisper legends on the horizon: who are you, occupant of the silent sigh of the conch? The ground seems only a memory now, a torn breath, and as we wait for the tide to flood the mudflats the song that reaches our ears is just our own. The cries of fishermen come drifting through the spray, music of what the world has lost.

The Moon Moments

The faint starlight rolls restlessly on the mat. Those women talking outside have clouds passing across their eyes. Always there is a moon that is taking me somewhere. Why does one room invariably lead into other room?
We, opening in time our vague doors, convinced that our minds lead to something never allowed before, sit down hurt under the trees, feeding it simply because it is there, as the wind does, blowing against the tree.
Yet time is not clairvoyant, and if it has the answer to our lives, proud in its possession of that potential which can change our natures, beating the visions of childhood out of us,
the socialism and the love, until we remain awkwardly swung to the great north of honour. What humility is that which will not let me reveal the real? What shameful secret lies hidden in the shadows of my moon?
All these years; our demands no longer hurt our eyes. How can I stop the life I lead within myselfThe startled, pleading question in my hands lying in my lap while the gods go by, triumphant, in the sacked city at midnight?

The Vase

The strong south wind hits our faces again, it's October; sunsets are fiery red and the waters of wells are clear alreadythere we are, under the mango tree, in the old house, amid the drift of things, the vase on the bookcase with shadows of swifts reeling round it, and we don't know whether we are alone any more.
But each day we watch the swifts come and go, watch the still-slender, teasing whore who shuffles down the crowded road and finds out that the middle-aged man surreptitiously following her is only listening to the slowing sounds of his own heart; and we sit and long for the child who left in 'seventy-three, and behave like our bitch that catches a scent and sniffs about in the air.
We look around today and the day after tomorrow, remembering those who caught us like irrigation-canals across the dry nights in the distant countryside, and remembering, suddenly, someone who once envied us and our bodies so impudent, glistening with rain.
Ah, this voice I hear now, what answer do I owe you? The tree trembles in the wind, the house where we once made love now weakens at the knees. And all the time that gathered into those moments fills the grave of the vast vase with dust.

Traveler

Every evening the bells of the temple close by rest their easy weight on the bones; it's time again to wonder what I'll do with what I learn. A warm vapor rises from the darkening earth like a hope. Somewhere, inside a room, a girl is dying in her mother's arms. Elsewhere, someone revenges himself for his broken life. I look at people. At my little misery. Beyond, at a jasmine's sad sweet smile. Movement here has purpose: It is not cold and tired. The deer chasing the new growth of grass. The drum thumping against the sky. The woman with her knees drawn to her chest. And the wind that deceives itself it has tellingly carried the scream of the girl who is dying in her mother's arms. My knowledge and my time fail to quiet to night unlike the flutter of birds. I try to wear this weight lightly. But the weight of the unknown buries me.

Twilight

An orange flare lights the pale panes of the hospital in a final wish of daylight. It's not yet dark.
In the chiildren's ward under a mother's face the dead, always so young. Water startles in the river's throat.
Its cry: a plea to share in its curse?
Somewhere, this twilight shall fall and hide the whiteness of jasmines about to bloom.
Newly-lit lamps in the houses across the street make me look out at the wet August evening that holds up the vast unknown in such small delicate hands.

A Summer Poem

Over the soughing of the sombre wind priests chant louder than ever; the mouth of India opens.
Crocodiles move into deeper waters.

Ash

The substance that stirs in my palm could well be a dead man; no need to show surprise at the dizzy acts of wind. My old father sitting uncertainly three feet away
is the slow cloud against the sky: so my heart's beating makes of me a survivor over here where the sun quietly sets. The ways of freeing myself:
the glittering flowers, the immensity of rain for example, which were limited to promises once have had the lie to themselves. And the wind, that had made simple revelation in the leaves,
plays upon the ascetic-faced vision of waters; and without thinking something makes me keep close to the walls as though I was afraid of that justice in the shadows.
Now the world passes into my eye: the birds flutter toward rest around the tree, the clock jerks each memory towards the present to become a past, floating away like ash, over the bank.
My own stirrings like the wind's keep hoping for the solace that would be me in my father's eyes to pour the good years back on my;
the dead man who licks my palms is more likely to encourage my dark intolerance rather than turn me toward some strangely solemn charade:
the dumb order of the myth lined up in the life-field, the unconcerned wind perhaps truer than the rest,
rustling the empty, bodiless grains.

Endless crow noises A skull in the holy sands tilts its empty country towards hunger.
White-clad widowed Women past the centers of their lives are waiting to enter the Great Temple
Their austere eyes stare like those caught in a net hanging by the dawn's shining strands of faith.
The fail early light catches ruined, leprous shells leaning against one another, a mass of crouched faces without names,
and suddenly breaks out of my hide into the smoky blaze of a sullen solitary pyre that fills my aging mother:
her last wish to be cremated here twisting uncertainly like light on the shifting sands

Deaths in Orissa

Faces of tree-bark and grief hang against God's hand in the world that cannot lift itself up to help. In the corners of women's eyes the rainbow breaks against the sunrise.
Nothing but the paddy's twisted throat exposed on the crippled bleak earth, nothing but impotence in lowered eyes, nothing but the tightening of the muscles in Bhagyabati's neck which her outcaste mother would herself have liked to throttle to death, nothing but the cries of shriveled women cracking against the bloodied altar of Man, nothing but the moment of fear when they need a God who can do them some good.
Oh I am a poet who barks like a dog. Open the window, I say, so I can breathe. Let not my memory be like a tiger in ambush. But there is this dangerously alive body and only a baton or knife can tear it apart.

An Introduction

I don't know politics but I know the names Of those in power, and can repeat them like Days of week, or names of months, beginning with Nehru. I amIndian, very brown, born inMalabar, I speak three languages, write in Two, dream in one. Don't write in English, they said, English is Not your mother-tongue. Why not leave Me alone, critics, friends, visiting cousins, Every one of you? Why not let me speak in Any language I like? The language I speak, Becomes mine, its distortions, its queernesses All mine, mine alone. It is half English, halfIndian, funny perhaps, but it is honest, It is as human as I am human, don't You see? It voices my joys, my longings, my Hopes, and it is useful to me as cawing Is to crows or roaring to the lions, it Is human speech, the speech of the mind that is Here and not there, a mind that sees and hears and Is aware. Not the deaf, blind speech Of trees in storm or of monsoon clouds or of rain or the Incoherent mutterings of the blazing Funeral pyre. I was child, and later they Told me I grew, for I became tall, my limbs Swelled and one or two places sprouted hair. WhenI asked for love, not knowing what else to ask For, he drew a youth of sixteen into the Bedroom and closed the door, He did not beat me But my sad woman-body felt so beaten. The weight of my breasts and womb crushed me. I shrank Pitifully. Then ... I wore a shirt and my Brother's trousers, cut my hair short and ignored My womanliness. Dress in sarees, be girl Be wife, they said. Be embroiderer, be cook, Be a quarreller with servants. Fit in. Oh, Belong, cried the categorizers. Don't sit On walls or peep in through our lace-draped windows.
Be Amy, or be Kamala. Or, better Still, be Madhavikutty. It is time to Choose a name, a role. Don't play pretending games. Don't play at schizophrenia or be a Nympho. Don't cry embarrassingly loud when Jilted in love ... I met a man, loved him. Call Him not by any name, he is every man Who wants. a woman, just as I am every Woman who seeks love. In him . . . the hungry haste Of rivers, in me . . . the oceans' tireless Waiting. Who are you, I ask each and everyone, The answer is, it is I. Anywhere and, Everywhere, I see the one who calls himself I In this world, he is tightly packed like the Sword in its sheath. It is I who drink lonely Drinks at twelve, midnight, in hotels of strange towns, It is I who laugh, it is I who make love And then, feel shame, it is I who lie dying With a rattle in my throat. I am sinner, I am saint. I am the beloved and the Betrayed. I have no joys that are not yours, no Aches which are not yours. I too call myself I.

It was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness Were in each of them. Even the crows were so Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in Attics and the urine of lizards and mice....

The Old Playhouse

You planned to tame a swallow, to hold her In the long summer of your love so that she would forget Not the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but Also her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless Pathways of the sky. It was not to gather knowledge Of yet another man that I came to you but to learn What I was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every Lesson you gave was about yourself. You were pleased With my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow Convulsions. You dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured Yourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed My poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. You called me wife, I was taught to break saccharine into your tea and To offer at the right moment the vitamins. Cowering Beneath your monstrous ego I ate the magic loaf and Became a dwarf. I lost my will and reason, to all your Questions I mumbled incoherent replies. The summer Begins to pall. I remember the rudder breezes Of the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. Your room is Always lit by artificial lights, your windows always Shut. Even the air-conditioner helps so little, All pervasive is the male scent of your breath. The cut flowers In the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. There is No more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old Playhouse with all its lights put out. The strong man's technique is Always the same, he serves his love in lethal doses, For, love is Narcissus at the water's edge, haunted By its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last An end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors To shatter and the kind night to erase the water.

Though peep-holes, the neighbours watch, they watch me come And go like rain. Ask me, everybody, ask me What he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, A libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake Before it clasps my pubis.

The Suicide

Bereft of soul My body shall be bare. Bereft of body My soul shall be bare. Which would you rather have O kind sea? Which is the more dead Of the two? I throw the bodies out, I cannot stand their smell. Only the souls may enter The vortex of sea. Only the souls know how to sing At the vortex of the sea. Your body shall be dead, Poor thing, Dead as driftwood, drifting And drifting to the shore. Your body shall ride the tide, Rider, slumped dead On white war-house. Charging. Your body shall bruise white Against the coral reefs, Your body, Your lonely body. I tell you, sea, I have enough courage to die, But not enough. Not enough to disobey him Who said: Do not die And hurt me that certain way. How easy your duties are. How simple. Only roar a hungry roar, Leao forward, And retreat. You swing and you swing, O sea, you play a child's game.
But, I must pose. I must pretend, I must act the role Of happy woman, Happy wife. I must keep the right distance Between me and the low. And I must keep the right distance Between me and the high. O sea, i am fed up I want to be simple I want to be loved And If love is not to be had, I want to be dead, just dead While I enter deeper, With joy I discover The sea's hostile cold Is after all skin-deep. The sea's inner chambers Are all very warm. There must be a sun slumbering At the vortex of the sea. O sea, i am happy swimming Happy, happy, happy ... The only movement i know well Is certainly the swim. It comes naturally to me. I had a house a Malabar And a pale-green pond. I did all my growing there In the bright summer months. I swam about and floated, And divided into the cold and green I lay speckled green and gold In all the hours of the sun, Until My grandmother cried, Darling, you must stop this bathing now. You are much too big to play Naked in the pond.
Yes, the only movement i really know Is swimming, It comes naturally to me. The white man who offers To help me forget, The white man who offers Himself as a stiff drink, Is for me, To tell the truth, Only water. Only a pale-green pond Glimmering in the sun. In him I swim All broken with longing. In his robust blood i float Drying off my tears. Yet i never can forget The only man who hurts. The only one who seems to know The only way to hurt. Holding you is easy Clutching at moving water, I tell you, sea, This is easy, But to hold him for half a day Was a difficult task. It required drinks To hold him down. To make him love. But, when he did not love, Believe me, All I could do was to sob like a fool. O sea, You generous cow, You and I are big flops. We are too sentimental For our own Good. Lights are moving on the shore. But I shall not return. Sea, toss my body back That he knew how to love.
Bereft of body My soul shall be free. Take in my naked soul That he knew how to hurt. Only the soul knows how to sing At the vortex of the sea.

Today the world is a little more my own. No need to remember the pain A blue-frocked woman caused, throwing Words at me like pots and pans, to drain That honey-coloured day of peace. `Why don't you join the others, what A peculiar child you are! '
On the lawn, in clusters, sat my schoolmates sipping Sugarcane, they turned and laughed; Children are funny things, they laugh In mirth at others' tears, I buried My face in the sun-warmed hedge And smelt the flowers and the pain.
The words are muffled now, the laughing Faces only a blur. The years have Sped along, stopping briefly At beloved halts and moving Sadly on. My mind has found An adult peace. No need to remember That picnic day when I lay hidden By a hedge, watching the steel-white sun Standing lonely in the sky.

Relationship

This love older than I by myriad Saddened centuries was once a prayer In his bones that made them grow in years of Adolescence to this favored height; yes, It was my desire that made him male And beautiful, so that when at last we Met, to believe that once I knew not his Form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness Of his lips was hard indeed. Betray me? Yes, he can, but never physically Only with words that curl their limbs at Touch of air and die with metallic sighs. Why care I for their quick sterile sting, while My body's wisdom tells and tells again That I shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace And even death nowhere else but here in My betrayer's arms...

Tall buildings impress me the ones which cut off half the sky. I like tall stories, even though false; not the half-truth sleeping with the half-lie. I want things on a large scale: amplitudes, a sense of space and light, the great yellow eye of the train lighting up the distances of the night. Urchins, furred caterpillars, moles and fern-beds are all right. But I want flowering trees, long streamers of moss, flaming parasites. But when you ask, still squirrel-young short as twilight short as a shadow at noon why I love you, what can I answer?

Al-Azhar Lecture

They are naïve, those who suggest that the fortunes of the ruler and the ruled go hand in hand. Take the plague of 1350, which traveled like a caravan from China across the Pamirs to the caravanserai called Egypt; rested here, refilled its water-skins and moved on to Europe. Twenty thousand died each day in Cairo, Mamluk, Emir and fellahin. But while the people sprouted buboes and the cattle broke out in blains and the Nile was scaled with dead shoals of silver-bellied fish, the Sultan got richer. When everyone dies who succeeds to property but the Sultan who embodies the state? Jazziya was another money spinner And the plague must have spared The non-Muslim - it often does. Can we blame the State Treasurer If, as he prayed, he asked Allah for more plagues and more unbelievers?

Suddenly The Tree

The hive slept like Argus its thousand eyes covered with bees. The light as it fell through the neem tree was a marine light, in which yellow moths set sail from one perforated shadow to another. The hive was mystic, a drugged mantra with its dark syllables asleep. As the afternoon wore on the honey-thieves came and smoked the bees out and carved out a honey-laden crescent for themselves and left a lump of pocked wax behind. The bees roamed the house, too bewildered to sting the children. At night they slept, clinging to the tree fork, now scarred with burns. Sparrows and squirrels, a bird with a black crest and a red half-moon for an eyelid bickered over the waxed remains the next day. Then with a drone of straining engines the bees rose like a swarm of passions from a dying heart, and left.

The Poseidonians

(After Cavafy)
[We behave like] the Poseidonians in the Tyrrhenian Gulf, who although of Greek origin, became barbarized as Tyrrhenians or Romans and changed their speech and the customs of their ancestors. But they observe one Greek festival even to this day; during this they gather together and call up from memory their ancient names and customs, and then lamenting loudly to each other and weeping , they go away.
Athenios, Deipnosophistai, Book 14, 31A [632]
All it takes to blight a language is another sun. It's not burn that does it, or chill, or the way woods straggle down the hills, or seas curl along the shingled coast. It is the women, cowering in fear, whom the soldiers, as they clamber down the boats, first reassure and then marry.
They are faithful, good with grain, at baking bread and fermenting wine and unscrambling the fish shoals from the meshes. They get the goddesses wrong sometimes [but so what?] Confusing mother with daughter. And there are minor errors In ritual and sacrifice, In lustration oils and libations.
A few seasons teach the man that his woman's omen birds are always right; her fears travel down the bloodstream and a new language emerges from the placenta.
What does one do with a thought that embarks on one script and lands on another? A hundred years go by, perhaps two hundred, Living with the Tyrrhenians and the Etruscans, and they discover there is more to language than merely words, that every act from making wine to making love filters through a different prism of sound, and they have forgotten the land they set sail from and the syllables that seeded that land.
What do they do, except once a year At a lyre-and-lute festival, Greek to the core, with dance and contests, grope for memories in the blood, like Demeter, torch in hand, looking for her netherworld daughter? And weep a little for the Greece they have lost and reflect on the gulf of years which has proved wider than the Tyrrhenian gulf, and the hiatus between languages, wider than the Aegean ? What can they do, but weep for Agora and Acropolis, forever left behind; and reflect, how three centuries distant from the Ionian coast, they have been barbarized by Rome?

Underwater Notes

(On revisiting a dream)
I am alone in the house. It is warm
but I feel cold. The doors swing open across the years. For someone who has no ancestral home, who doesn't have the long shadow of the past
to ruffle his hair, homecoming gets distorted. Time squints, space wobbles and the visit, encoded as it is, remains undeciphered.
It is cold, the windows are frost-smudged. Counsel yourself, there's no one
else to do it. Let hieroglyphs remain dented where they are. Let wind erode them, or time they are warp and weft of all erosion. Come out of the house and write (not hieroglyphs this time!) It is cold. Frost has smudged the windows. Your hair is grey as hoarfrost.
A rundown house, is a desolation. A rundown house perched on a live memory,
with me alone conversing with both is a double desolation. Twenty years ago when I took a look around It wasn't there. Someone now tells me at a reunion the house is standing, only new streets interlock around it. It's still there! That's nice, one desolation gets sloughed off .
It's only when reality slips by like a sliding panel that you realize that the marvellous in the everyday real has passed you by.
Seated on the hull of your boat you lurch and tilt. The horizon is the forest, darkening leaf on darkening sky.
Slot your time properly in the right caves. The sea is the present The forest is the future.
Speech is present tense Echo is the future.
If you are talking of echoes you are talking of walls. If you talk of water echo you are discussing womb walls odd territory,
come out of it. Unsure on land
you take to the sea. The skyline is a forest Fern-dark, shadow-dark graveled with white coral grit.
Whatever evil he suffered, he forgot said Milosz in one of his poems. Now that's a scrap of myth, isn't it? And it is one thing to forgive and another to forget. I tried to put things behind me, in the backyards of memory-clutter, and went back to my flirtations with altitudes, touched the Karakorams at Siachen, touched - Hindi has such a lovely word for it, `sparsh' Nubra, the garden of the North and slept in a tent at Tsomoriri the rocks brown, the lake blue; I got hold of a scrap of a myth here (at 15000 feet it's a good scrap to grab). It was very hot, and a woman called Tsomo riding a yak couldn't rein him in, as the yak made straight for the lake. She kept shouting `riri, riri', `stop, stop' in Tibetan, but the yak went in and they both drowned.
The stars have flung their net into the sea Among the thrashing fish shoal and the lassoed crab look for me.

Wolf

Fire-lit half silhouette and half myth the wolf circles my past treading the leaves into a bed till he sleeps, black snout on extended paws. Black snout on sulphur body he nudged his way into my consciousness. Prowler, wind-sniffer, throat-catcher, his cries drew a ring around my night; a child's night is a village on the forest edge. My mother said his ears stand up at the fall of dew he can sense a shadow move across a hedge on a dark night; he can sniff out your approaching dreams; there is nothing that won't be lit up by the dark torch of his eyes. The wolves have been slaughtered now. A hedge of smoking gun-barrels rings my daughter's dreams.

Alexander Crosses The Hellespont

He was a little tentative when it came to the East. Its ways were quite insidious and odd to say the least.
His experience was unhappy: His first stop had been Cairo where he had gone to dropp his card and call on the Pharoah.
They laid a banquet for him At the Casino Mariot and placed by Pope Shenodah who but Judas Iscariot!
The Turks would be more organized he fondly hoped - and damn! He couldn't cross the Hellespont. There was a traffic jam.
He raged and ranted fiercely ;I must have been a fool to try and venture into intestinal Istanbul.
When do we get to Asia?; Great Alexander probed. ;When Effendi comes to Turkia He comes from Europe to Europe.
You can check with CNN Or ask the BBC. When you come to Turkey You come to EEC.;
He remembered Aristotle: ;Son, at the Turkish Rail ask for the Occident Express The Occidental Mail.;
As he checked into a hotel - the Turks call it Oteli he found Thais lodged in Hilton while he was in Surmeli.
What really turned his eyes into two glowing bits of phosphorous was that his friend Hephaestion checked into Hotel Bosphorous.
His face turned dark and sullen as a cloud's before a storm. And though they humoured him he screamed ;I want Hephaestion!;
They offered handsome eunuchs, whores from the Golden Horn. But Alexander kept on saying ;I want Hephaestion;.
Thias phoned ;I am bored at Hilton, And I am quite akeli.; But he said what can I do for I am at Surmeli!;
And Mehmet Ali Pasha, a little high on raaki asked poor Alexander if he was an Iraqi?
Then in the hotel dining room dressed in salwar-kameez, a man accosted him and said ;could I have your good name please?
Arrey Janab Sikandar Sahab! Myself Assad Durrani. Oh what a treat it is to meet a fellow Pakistani.;
Alexander answered darkly Thanks very much Janab. Tell Porus inshah Allah We'll be meeting in Punjab.;
He drove the Persians backwards right up to Tarbela. He beat them up at Granicus. He thrashed them at Arbela.
While he uncorkd the champagne and lit the fireworks, who should speak but Spoil Sport Parmenio, the jerk. ;Sire, though you thrashed the Persians, you never touched a Turk.;

Before The Word

Corn is great, on the cob or otherwise, but before corn in the ear there was life. Fire is holy especially for Zoroastrians, but before fire too there was life. Before the bowstring and the flint arrow sang, there was life.
The word is great, yet there was life before the word. We can't turn romantic and say we were into bird speech or river-roar then, into the silence of frost or the language of rain. But forest speech and swamp speech came through easier to us. When lightning crashed, the cry of the marsh bird was our cry, and we flung ourselves to the other branch like any other baboon.
As winter whined on windy cliff, we shivered with the yellow grass. In winter-dark a hundred eyes flared yellow in the jungle scrub. When seasons changed, blood coursed with sap and flowered in meadows. We were at home. Nor eyes nor bat cries bothered us. What if we didn't know a bat assessed reality from the ricochet of its cry?
Though there were no words, fear had a voice with many echoes. Worship was quieter, adoration spoke only through the eyes or knees.
What was it like before language dropped like dew, covering the scuffed grass of our lives?

Fish

The sea came in with her and her curved snout and her tin coloured barnacles and long threaded rose moles patterned on her body.
The sea brought her and her curved snout and her rose moles and her eyes still translucent as if half aware and half unaware of the state of her body.
The sea came in with her and her scimitar snout and her translucent eyes greying into stone.
The sea brought her in, wrapped in seaweed and slapped her on the sand, all five feet of her with the armour of her scales and the filigree of her rose moles.
The tide kept coming in but couldn't disturb her or her resting place she was heavy.
The sea fell back but even as the thin-edged foam line receded, it went to her once more with a supreme effort, rummaged among her barnacles and left.

Map-Maker

Perhaps I'll wake up on some alien shore In the shimmer of an aluminium dawn, to find the sea talking to itself and rummaging among the lines I've drawn; looking for something, a voyager perhaps, gnarled as a thorn tree in whose loving hands, these map lines of mine, somnambulant, will wake and pulse and turn to shoreline, sand.
The spyglass will alight on features I've forecast cape, promontory - he'll feel he's been here, that voyaging unlocks the doorways of the past.
And deep in the night, in the clarity of dream, The seafarer will garner his rewards, raking in his islands like pebbles from a stream.
Does the world need maps, where sign and symbol, standing as proxies, get worked into scrolls? You see them, mountain chains with raingods in their armpits and glaciers locked like glass-slivers in their folds. Desert, scrub, pasture - do they need shading? They're all there for the eye to apprehend. A family of cactus and camelthorn tells you where one begins and the other ends.
These questions confound me, I'd rather paint for a while - a ship on the skyline, or cloud-shadow moving like a spreading stain. Yet they live, pencil strokes that speak for rain and thunder; and die - maplines ghosting round a cycloned island that has gone under.
Forget markings, forget landfall and sea. Go easy Man, I tell myself; breathe. Gulls will mark the estuary for you, bubbles will indicate where the swamps seethe. Map the wrinkles on the ageing skin of love. Forget Eastings, Northings - they stand for order. Cry, if you must, over that locust line flayed open into a barbarized border.
Mark a poem that hasn't broken forth, map the undefined, the swamp within, the hedge between love and hate. Forget the coastal casuarinas line.
Reefs one can handle. It's lust that seeks out its quarry that one cannot map, nor that heaving salt of desire that floods the creeks.
If you map the future, while a millennium moves on its hinges, you may find the present turned into an anachronism. This too is important - what is yours and mine, The silk of these shared moments. But having stuck to love and poetry, heeding the voice of reason; and experiencing the different textures of a season of love and love's eternal season,
I put a clamp on yearning, shun latitudes, renounce form. And turn my eye to the far kingdom of bloodless Kalinga battling with a storm. Dampen your fires, turn from lighthouse, spire, steeple. Forget maps and voyaging, study instead the parched earth horoscope of a brown people.

Migrations

Migrations are always difficult: ask any drought, any plague; ask the year 1947. Ask the chronicles themselves: if there had been no migrations would there have been enough history to munch on?
Going back in time is also tough. Ask anyone back-trekking to Sargodha or Jhelum or Mianwali and they'll tell you. New faces among old brick; politeness, sentiment, dripping from the lips of strangers. This is still your house, Sir.
And if you meditate on time that is no longer time (the past is frozen, it is stone, that which doesn't move and pulsate is not time) if you meditate on that scrap of time, the mood turns pensive like the monsoons gathering in the skies but not breaking.
Mother used to ask, don't you remember my mother? You'd be in the kitchen all the time and run with the fries she ladled out, still sizzling on the plate. Don't you remember her at all? Mother's fallen face would fall further at my impassivity. Now my dreams ask me If I remember my mother And I am not sure how I'll handle that.
Migrating across years is also difficult.

Notes From The Underground

The wind is cold and the wind burns. The wind is cold and the wind is acid. On the Bar counter ice and amber swirl in thick gleaming glasses; in the Bar the ash of small talk, the smoke of ruminations. Light purrs on a bare shoulder, her feet are hidden in the drooping hem of her sari; ice and amber swirling I sit here between betweens, to the left of voices to the right of memory. Thought floats into the slow silence of air currents; the hours squat with me as I snap connections in autumn leaf detachment.
Nowhere to say this no one to say this to except to the typewriter (the computer would store it in its chip-memory and that could be embarrassing) as she pulled out he turned into a dead crab beach when the sea pulls out
Were the sea to pull out sea birds would pull out and the breeze; shells would turn brittle under crackling boot; fish and fishermen
would be sucked into the great ebb and our traders would turn the white sea bed into 'The Salt Crystal Shopping Arcade', selling grounded oil tankers, ocean liners dredged out of the mud and whales flaked in salt. You could buy goldfish though as they circle the belly of a water jar.
You didn't come with me to the mountains this time, but as you know when you climb mountains the stars get nearer; don't ask me why this happens or how this happens but it happens when constellations smile death drops your catch. but often the stars go about their office routine in the night sky like glum bureaucrats this astral bureaucracy is even more baffling in its ways than our central ministries. In auto mode Rahu gets into the act; So does the moon debris that swirls around Saturn and forms its rings. Then what has to happen, happens. That's what happened to you.
The almond tree flowers white; beside it the peach flowers, as only peach can with its own interpretation of pink; and further in the lofty rear,
winter has left its brown imprint on mountain and crag. Perhaps with the rains green may return to the slopes, a little moss here, a little grass there; you never know though, the rains may never come or life may run out before the rains the almond blossom, each petal soft as an eyelid, will also not see the rain. They are divided by a scimitar: parched landscapes and rain, parched lips and love.
Watching the wind-ruffled down on bird-breast I think for no particular reason of wind through quivering paddy in the Nepal terai.
I think I am at peace now, he said, for my dreams move like the thinnest veil of mist over water. Awareness of absences, of what is right with me or wrong with me is also like the perception of a veil of mist over a perception of water.

Long and lonely are my nights. Come help me Goddess, end my blight; her absence burns me, burns my sides with love intense.

Her absence scars my empty flank. Goddess you don't need my verse to tell you this. My love is frank, I can't dissemble so.

To have designs on another Degrades oneself; The old Greek was right, Platonic love is the best. I knew this all along, Preached this doctrine, But couldn'd practice it myself. To love is to give But what does a beggar, Himself needy, wandering the streets, Pan-handling for love, Know of giving himself to another? No, he's too self-absorbed: He ventures in vain And returns as restless as he went.
So what are my options? To remain strictly monogamous, Regard every other woman As a mother or sister? To be desireless for ever Without romance, appreciation, power? Or else to evade the issue altogether And play it by the ear?
Though I'm not at all sure To lay down rules which I must follow, I think this much I know: I don't want to settle into A boring and dull domesticity; I want the freedom, however illusive, To make friends, to seek afresh. I don't think my romance with women Has yet reached its end. And yet I detest promiscuity or fornication: Sex without soul is sordid. So deception, whether with self, Spouse or girlfriend, is out. Then what's left?
Love-which is the other side of TruthNoble and fine and spiritual Without a particle of jealousy or possessiveness, More or less a dream, difficult to find: Bhakti of friend to friend The distillation of _sringara rasa_ Which made Krishna a brahmacharin Though he had over sixteen thousand wives.
For the girls involved It must be an experience To be loved as they have never been Before or after: Post-experience innocence. So, O Mother, teach me how to be Your boyfriend: Let that be my way of winning hearts And saving souls.

Before saying anything else, Let me declare that I cherish youEven unto eternity, to you a part of me belongs. I am grateful for all that you've done for me and my loyalty to you will never falter. For like Krishna, my loves are many And for every step that you've taken towards me, I shall take two steps towards you. I am sorry if I imposed myself on you Sorry if my insistence made you anxious: If thirsting is adolescence, I don't know if I am grown up even now. Each of you tried to teach me a lesson Which I did not learn: Don't ask for love, wait to receive it. How unreasonable if not impossible were my demands How hard I made it for myself and for you. You have every right to think of me unkindly As a tiresome jerk who couldn't take no for an answer. Yet I don't want to forget you, To reject my past, to lay old ghosts to rest, To clear all debts with one measly poem. Now that many of you are happily married, You know I shall wish you the very best, Of happiness, love, and prosperity, And for those who are still single, I wish you the partner of your choice And a life full of fulfillment ahead. So won't you, as my old friends and lovers, Join this ceremony now and lend strength With your good wishes, to this verse-necklace For my wife: as I tie it around her neck Like a sacred _mangalsutra_, won't you
Hands poised, shower on us consecrated rice As they do confetti in western weddings?

Getting Outside Patriarchy
Our distances are intimate, We grow vast in our silences. In freedom we have blossomed, Not having thwarted one another. How unrestricted are our movements: We have never tried to trim each other to size.
You come back, asynchronious, Twisted by your concourse with others. I react to your divergences. How we have fought, With no holds barred Tearing at each other fiercely, Until our brains nearly exploded. Then, all anger spent, Not one word or hit, left unstruck, We gaze at each other mutelyAstonished at the devastation Each has wrought on the other. Standing forlorn amidst the debris of our selves, We heal, and once again Stretch towards each other, All our crooked places straightened.
We are the enemies of each other's egos Ruthless in hunt; Thus we destroy and recreate each other ceaselessly. Yet our eyes talk and understand The subtle signals of love, The open smile of happiness Wrapping the other in a warm embrace. Indeed, our gestures are complete.
My curses have failed. The blows that I struck you Drained me of all violence. Even memories have lost their sting. Instead, eternal be my blessing Overflowing all the harsh sayings,
Washing them away like loose dirt.
So go, you are not mineProsper and flower wherever you are. And yet stay, Grow strong and straight Like a companion eucalyptus, Tall and elegant, And restless in the breeze.

Approach The path is six hundred years old. On the way you will see peacocks And, if you are lucky, some deer. From this parapet The empty, dried lake looks like An immense ditch, A grotesque seventy-acre dugout-- A gouged eye of earth. The old emperor chose this quiet spot For his grave. There he isIn a simple enclosure of sandstone That anyone can approach. Beside him lie a son and a grandson To keep him company, perhaps.
Does she remember How this place intrigued us? We haunted it constantly, Walking here from her house To be alone, together. We speculated upon these ruins From the sketchy tourist notice Put at the entrance by the archaeological survey: Just this brief walk would turn centuries. We sat overlooking the pit, Holding hands sometimes While the attendant slyly looked on. Does she remember The December sun soaking into us? And how one day The birds flew away when we came, Flapping in an enormous mottled flock from the tomb. 'They're migrating,' she pronounced, In her characteristic, solemn, symbolic way. Does she remember?
This hollow goes back to times before Altamash. But it was Firoz Shah who made it a lake
Cementing the sides, clearing the bottom, Sealing it to hold water. The college, which Firoz Shah also built, Is almost in ruins. Only the pillared assembly hall still stands.
The lawns are well-maintained And the walls of the tomb Are not disfigured With the names of vain lovers.
Night. In the steely moonlight, The royal lake slowly fills up Before my eyes. I hear the ripple of gentle water. Behind me, the scholars are asleep In their cramped quarters. The burly, heavily armed Afghan guard, With a sharp, close-cut beard Dozes, leaning on his spear.

Her Strategy
She got a lot done by doing so little; She said, 'I love you,' and left the rest to him.
She fed him, nursed him, and slaved for him; She was no feminist but, when the time came, she left him.
He wandered, beast-like, ash-smeared, covered with hides, Until she reclaimed him and made him a human being.
As the moth entered, the flame shone even more brightly; He realized that such deaths don't come so easily.
He boasted, blustered, threatened to leave her forever; Instead, he fell unconscious until her touch revived him.
During the day she was flamboyant, bold, quick; But at night she pleaded, darling please turn out the lights.
When she went to Kathmandu, he went to Kanyakumari Only to discover that the continent wasn't large enough to divide them.
When the veil dropped, the incense became camphor, not musk; Chastened, he prayed, O Mother, please forgive my profanities.
He thought he could teach her a lesson or two in celibacy But he found a child asleep beside him who'd forgotten her sex completely.
After years of abnegation, recovering his wits he looked at her appealingly But she wasn't a switch to be turned on or off at will.
Obsessed with performance he wished to go on and on; Relax, she said, this isn't 'publish or perish.'
Insecure to the extreme, he tried to steal her friends Until, one by one his friends said that they preferred her to him.
He proposed to a hundred women and became a laughing stock; When she accepted him, they weren't more astonished than him.
Our love is so ordinary, he thought, looking at their lives; But she never complained: he lacked imagination, not she.

In Lieu Of The Missing Poem
Dear Reader,
A poem at the centre of the collection, Is missing, as you can gather. To speak truly, its absence, equally Baffles me. Did I lose it to computer virus Or did the censor excise it; Or were there only twenty-nine in all, Making this the unwritten poem? Or does this represent the overwhelmingly absent presence, Suggesting, like nirvana or the impossible Revolution, something that we strive towards, But never attain-I mean, Love? Thus it becomes all that I was unable to say, The sunya in the heart of purna, The cavity in the middle of the decentred Text; in a word, the death of the self, (Or instead of the missing poem, these sixteen lines.)

To make even one single person happy, To love her completely, to give her without restraint All that you could if your were God himself; Or to love, even a plant, an animal, Any piece of life; to nurture it, To care, to have tenderness for someone else; Even to do this just once, fully and entirely, Is to fulfill one's life and find heaven afterwards.

Untouched by the words it sings The voice retains its pristine quality. Even when the lyrics signify messy happeningsHeart-break, perfidy, crass sensuality: The guiltless voice countenances the emotions, Rehabilitating them to their original innocence. What a range of love has she expressed, Unrivalled in achievement and finesse. Yet she retains the untainted sacred spirit: The high-priestess of love remains a virgin.
II She sings of love profane The voice is coquettish and throaty Suggesting rich experience: It promises fulfillment Of passions, ecstasies, desires, The silky intoxication of the self-annihilating embrace, An invitation to seize the night, For tomorrow is uncertain and yesterday unknown: So come into my inviting arms, she sings... After all, flesh is flesh.
Thus together the two demonstrate in love The sisterhood of the spirit and flesh.

I read the love poems of others With quiet disgustThe unending obsession with sex, The sad broken lives, The innumerable trials To find understanding, perfection; It is like walking with bare feet On broken glass.
The incompleteness Of their lives leaves the mind Pensive and soulful, Like an autumn sky at dusk. In the midst of this you stand out Like a torch of pure white flame Devoid of smoke. And our love for each other flows on Like a bubbling stream of clear water Over the pebbles of life; Very quietly, with minimal fuss, Devoid of allurement or disguise. Oh! the peace of the desireless mind!

The song was of lovers entangled In an impossible relationship: After the blossoming of passion, Now the inevitable separation. The only question that remained Was how to make the parting As painless as possible-
Come, once more, Let us become strangers To one another...
The room was full of people, Many couples Seated together or apart, Tied by uneasy threads, Primarily of matrimony, But perhaps, also of sex, Jealousy, and ownership.
And the thought struck me: What if we were strangers once more? Having freedom again, would I turn elsewhere With frenzy and anticipation? If I had to start all over again Would I want to only with you? As if in answer, Our angularities dropped away, Revealing only the eternal feminine And the eternal masculine. Our personalities vanished Like bubbles of white foam On the dark, silent sea of life.
III
Of late, I have grown superstitious. The other day, for instance, I thought About the ritual we couldn't perform: Seven circumambulations around the fire, Garments knotted. Looking into your eyes, I wonder What secret cord ties us to each other then? And the inevitability of our situation Suddenly becomes clear. There is no one else to turn to: In our union, The world comes to an end.
At night, Your palm in mine, softens Like that of a child. Sometimes you call me in your sleep. Who are you, I ask Trying to peer beneath the mind that chose me. But only the echo of my question
Reprimands, 'As if you have to ask! '
Long ago, I stopped thinking about you And you passed from Thought into being. What a relief that was When you merged Simply, into existence. For me, you are. I never have to think what, Just as I never question What I am.

Love Poetry
After months of silence, there comes a day When I feel I can turn anything I wish to say Into poetry. And they talk so much About the discipline of being a poet, Of setting up schedules for practicing the craft. But look at us vagrants-the muse feeds us too, And we too manage to scrape by. So Ezekiel was right. As it is with love, it must be with poetry: Wait, wait, wait, and never force the pace. Years vanish behind one, leaving only the debris Of so many wasted afternoons with no sympathy, No relief, no reward. Then the pain And humiliation of so many rejections; jealousy And rage over the success of other poets, And one's own pathetic rationalizationsHe knew so and so, she was lucky-and throughout The same nagging question: 'Am I of any worth?' But then this also passes and one feels A lightness, freedom, and confidence, That comes from having nowhere to go, No one really to speak to, none to impress. So, my doors are ever open to you, poetry, Come when you will: how can I seek you and what for? Effort destroys poetry as it destroys love.

Love's Success
Love always exceeds its objects which, however great or beautiful, are subject to time, decay, and death: after their brief season in the sun, they lose their fresh bloom, so magical, and harden slowly or rot in their youth. But love remains eternally youthful, whether embodied as a silly, naked boy wilfully shooting his invisible darts at unsuspecting victims, or entirely bodiless, too subtle to behold, but still quivering in every heart's secret places. Love is not subject to us, but we are subject to it: it changes its objects like soiled garments or the deathless soul it's transient bodies.

Apostrophe To Poverty
Poverty is not so easy to attain. It is not all misery-belly-pinching brats, motherless, naked and dirty, let loose among garbage heaps on squalid streets; it is not always a toothless importunate hag, shrunken and gaunt, who, accosting you on the footpath, clings and clings, pleading she has no other refuge; it is not always the slum in Calcutta or Bombay where during the monsoon, the pus of the city oozes, and women, with babies at their breasts wade across filthy gutters by the roadside to reach their dissolute hovels; it is not always some leper on display, limbs arranged on a cart, a wrinkled begging bowl of tin balanced between stubs of arms, pushed by his bandaged companion. We, for whom poverty is the only sin, miss the true meaning of what it is to be poor.
Regard myself in my own comfortable cage twenty concrete floors above the common street surrounded by my solacing clutter of machines: my washers, dryers, heaters, coolers, mixers, air-conditioners, refrigerators, cookers, grinders, dish washers, vacuum cleaners, hi-fi stereos, CD-Romswonderful possessions, too numerous to mentionfabricate my secure and happy delusions. My day which ended with a sedative, begins with the alarm of a chronometer made in Japan. Wired to a shaver, I adjust temperatures, turn on the coffee maker, automatically dispose garbage, receive recorded messages from the office, blip the tube for the Morning News, open refrigerator, collect dishes from the washer, breakfast instantly, and if not constipated, defecate, shower, shampoo, condition, blow-dry hair, dress, descend in the elevator to my automobile, waiting in the bowels of the building. After I leave, the fluffy carpet smothers the floor, bolted windows preserve the air-conditioning; pets, and potted plants on display, strategically placed for effect, languish
for want of sunshine and air.
Regard myself among all these, my indispensable possessions. Can I one muffled night, walk away from all this that ties me? can I, oppressed by my fears and uncertainties, disappear into the night to find all the answers? 'I shall not rest until I have found the truth'can I take such a vow and simply leave in the dark without even a note, as over two thousand years ago Gautama did? With all my engagements, can I without notice, even take a vacation? No, impossible. I will be registered with the Missing Persons Bureau. The media will blare my absence; the major newspapers announcing a reward for my capture, will print my picture; my wife will hire detectives to track me down, and if I am found, she will probably file for divorce, suing me for desertion and maltreatment. Afterwards, endless alimony payments will follow as a matter of course. No, my friend, even if I want to, I cannot be poor.
Poverty, the plain fact is, cannot be inherited; it has to be acquired, for it is a quality of the mind. Poverty is the lack of need, not the want of possessions. It cannot be forced, because it is voluntary. He who knows what it is to be poor, always walks upright; using only what he needs, refusing all excesses, he is the essential man, without any superfluity.
Or, consider another angle: we humans are beings of spirit and flesh. some stuff the spirit, starve the flesh, some starve the spirit and stuff the flesh. Some die of too little, some die of too much, and all those who die are equal. Hence, privation and repletion are variations of the same illness. So don't think that being rich, in itself, is better than being poor, for in the ultimate analysis, despite your wealth, can you deny, that in truth you own only yourself?
Beyond a certain point,I do not care to prolong this argument. These words formed in indignation always dissolve in a calm beyond comment. My philosophy is simple though some consider it partisan and limited: the poor define their opposites; without them none would be rich. Hence, if nothing else, let me here declare my allegiance to my deprived countrymen, however unlike them I may be. Let poverty be my lot, let me make this meagre offering at the shrine of indigence. Having now come out into the open, taken sides for the rest of my days, let me end, on a note of uncharacteristic bluntness: we mustn't extend our judgements to what we do not comprehend; we should accept each other, as we are--rich or pooror mind our own business, please.

Magan Bhai
Before he committed suicide Magan Bhai met me one night my parents were out at a movie. Ringing the doorbell at an unusual hour, he stood in the doorway and started a conversation. A small, dapper fellow in his twenties, he had married young, and had a daughter in the first standard. Today he was misty-eyed and smelled of whiskey. The talk turned to films which were his passion. Before he joined the Company, he had been an usher at the Bombay Talkies. 'You must have seen your favourite films several times,' I remarked. 'Ah yes,' he said, &quot;but it was so boring to see the same films again and again. There were a very few,&quot; he mused, &quot;which were good enough for thatKagaz ke Phool-Paper Flowers-- have you seen it?was certainly one of them.&quot;
Like its protagonist, he claimed, he was a man much abused and misunderstood by the world: 'Here I am, no more really than the caretaker of the Guest House: paid a pittance per month, but from my lifestyle can you tell my income? Look at my clothes: aren't they as smart as yours? Have you ever seen me wearing a wrinkled shirt? You may wonder how I manage
Well, that's the whole secret of my existence. By the grace of God I have been favoured with luck on the race course. I have laid up money to start a small-scale industry. If my daughter wants to study abroad, I have enough in the bank for her. Can you believe that right now I am actually a partner in a small store on Brigade Road? Yes, I have done my duty, paid my dues. Today I am a free man. No one can fault me if I'm gone....' His voice tremulous, his loosened tongue wagged on until one a.m.
Actually, he died leaving a pile of unpaid debts. So well-behaved, so respectful to his employers and superiors, no one suspected that he ran up the company account with grocers in the city for thousands of rupees. He had lost at the track, lost at the card table; and, when the Directors were out, he sat at the bar of the Guest House drinking the choicest liquors at Company expense. And one day, when he could no longer sustain the act, they found him dead, sprawled on the expensive carpet, his face the colour of sandpaper, and a can of 'Tik-20' (specially purchased for the rose garden) half-empty by his side.
His death was reported as 'Accident on Duty,' which allowed his wife to collect the maximum coverage on the insurance. She was spared the debts, but not the humiliation, and left with his child for a faceless widowhood in some backward village.
After the event, the inevitable verbal post-mortem: what had spoiled Magan Bhai? What had turned his head? 'He ought to have belonged to some wealthy family where his princely instincts might have come to aught,' commiserated a fellow-worker. In public, however, everyone roundly condemned the vices that led to his end, pointing out his case, as a moral unto the others. A few of his cronies (their wives thanked heaven) suddenly turned pious; but most, after a brief suspense, relapsed to their former ways. The company Physician (who had certified the death as accidental) relaxing over a scotch with my father confidentially observed: 'Born penniless, hardly educated, could Magan ever have attained the good life he so badly craved? No! Not in this lifetime! Attempting short-cuts to wealth and power in a society structured for little upward movement
he was bound to fail.' I overheard their sober reflections in silence.
Magan Bhai, always the first volunteer in any community event, who took us when we were young to movies and cricket matches, is forgotten today. The Directors, of course, deigned no comments on his untimely death, but ordered that the new valet in his place be watched closely each day.

Miss Gobble
The unkempt municipal garden between the college and the railway station provides the setting for our action. In a secluded corner, shaded by the old neem squats a bench once probably green, now carved with sundry profanities. There once a week, we keep our tryst. At night if there are no drunks prowling, or cops on the beat, the park is your territory. Then carrying my awkward burden, of necessity, in you I seek release. Better your deal, I think than descending to base extremes; besides I am told, by shunning intercourse, one can prevent disease. But even if that's not true and I'm equally susceptible with you, I'd come-because, how shall I put it?you have a way with such things. Also, you always perform single-handedly and I hate go-betweens, or solicitings. Last, but not the least, you charge only ten rupees.
Once the money is paid and my knees are conveniently splayed, you consider it unprofessional to delay. So whether I am at my best or worst, I usually succumb, because you have me quite literally, under your thumb. Then in the crook of your palm, you give me a quick run-down of all the skills at your command; no wonder I prefer you to my right hand. But, by now I am ready to stand on my own, so you promote me to the preferred location.
Sometimes I wonder at our situation. I don't know your name, or from where you come; we hardly speak the same language and, indeed, have so little in common; then how do we manage
to get so much done? When my thoughts take such a turn, my position undergoes a drastic alteration. Suddenly, I become assailed by unwelcome sensationsthe open noisome gutter, is just one example; then, your own not too pleasant odour, bothers. With our chronic water shortage, such inconveniences, I know, cannot be helped; but they add to the squalor of your already sullied vocation. In this manner, while you are busy plying your intention and in the dark, your face betrays no emotion, I lapse into these depressing cogitations: how do you, with only a mouthful or two for supper go to bed each night on an empty stomach? And despite my precautions, I get deeply involved in the poverty of your lot.
But on this point I get unsettled: you deftly twist your tongue and without knowing it, I emit a deep groan. You grab the advantage, perk up operations; I retreat a bit from too much stimulationat this critical juncture, I suddenly lose control over the situation: unable to prolong the transaction, heedless of repercussions, I acquit myself to my utmost satisfaction.
But by this time the issue has staled, and, your dues being already settled, I feel disinclined to extend this session. Walking off, I leave you on the bench tidying-up. Incidentally, your next client happens to be someone I know; his room is opposite mine on the same floor. Perhaps he'll dropp in afterwards to compare notes.

My Buried Youth
Each vacation, we measured our years by the progress of the new tar road.
Electricity had come when I was very young, but the servant quarter was yet unwired. A flickering wick on the earthen floor cast warm, inviting shadows. There, at sundown, the handymen relaxed on haunches, softly chatting, and their beedies, at each deep puff, fiercely glowed. In the little room to the right of the hall ranged sooty lanterns, ready for special uselike when you had to, after dark, visit the latrine which was by the distant compound wall, or when unexpectedly, the electricity went off.
On the dark, empty beach, there we could be free to play out our fantasies. Two cousins in pony tails, flushed with youth, would pretend to be film stars. They taught us, in English, to say 'Hi' and 'Bye' which was pretty ahead of our times in 1965. The wind sighed its longing through the evergreens, and the sea complained constantly even when out of sight. By sunset, we had to leave though our castles were incomplete. On the way back, a broken club-house and tennis court always spiced our curiosity: who could have played tennis, here in this remote, undeveloped village?
The spacious wash house was built around the well. It was dark and cool, even in the hottest spells: if you came in from the bright warm sun, it took some blinking before you could see clearly again. In the large well hung a deep and friendly silence. Its stones were mossed and slippery. When you let go the rusty bucket, the wooden pulley whirred. The splash that followed was always superficial: you had to wait for the bucket to drink its fill before plying the pulley, whose old handles were smoothened by rough palms. When the dripping bucket emerged,
the brown, whiskered cord glistened, wet and taut. In the morning, still together, but not so well-disposed standing in single file, we brushed our teeth, grumbled, and the dark gutter was streaked with our white spittle. An old bronze boiler supplied the hot water. The aunts, with soap and towel, retreated into the smaller rooms taking one bucket of well-water, another steaming hot. They warmed the stone seat before closing the door; then, emptying pitcherfuls over their shoulders, the bath.
Before supper-time, long prayers had to be intoned. Perched cross-legged on a broad, creaking swing we feigned earnestness by swaying to the beat, but when left to ourselves, never failing to skip.
By nine, we lay on charpoys in the yard, gazing at the sky. On moonlit nights, the yellow champak was fragrant and luminous; there were earth smells too, the plants being freshly watered, and in season, the lush scent of mangoes ripening in the porch. The custom was to tell each other stories, until no one spoke except the cicadas, who kept tedious vigil without repose.
My great-grandfather built that mansion for a sum of only rupees six thousand. (But that was in 1907.) He was a pleader in the Thane district court, sufficiently modern to smoke. His brand: 555s, which then came in round tins. With cane, topi, and waxed moustache, he is portrayed upstairs in black-and-white. In a dusty closet rest some of his things: an ancient iron safe effectively conceals debentures and bonds of poor investments, an insurance policy that returned no yields. Dozing undisturbed for decades, cob webbed shelves retain withered tomes, ledgers, rusted biscuit cases, invoices, faded letterheads, clotted ink, quills, lacquered paperweights; underneath, on the chest, bandages, enema equipment, enamel bowls,
scented water in sealed bottles, rusted scissors, red salve, rats bane, ointment, tincture iodine, epsom salts...
I could, of course, go on, but to cut the long story short, when the road reached the shrine of the Monkey God, as you are likely to have guessed by now, we went far away from our ancestral home. That summer, hoping, as usual, to return, I hid something precious in the pigeon cote in the musty alcove over the parlour door. Now continents later, unsure of my past, in vain I try to recollect that nuance. I know I mourn a conventional lossyou too, I dare say, wistfully long for one or two memories, misplaced beyond recall. My childhood belongs to another tongue, it briefly came back to me just now, like snatches of a forgotten song. You don't blame me, do you, for writing these fragments down?

Papiah
After a month's vacation when Papiah returned to work, his hands were spotted white, as with leukoderma. Preceding him, the news of the scandal had spread: the seniormost driver of the firm discarding his wife and children, had settled down hereabouts with a woman of ill-repute. Recently, in a fire at her house, instead of deserting 'the whore,' he had risked his life to save her; and in the process, the burns. Faced with all this slander, Papiah conducted himself with laudable indifference. With a spitefulness peculiar to children, I decided to try him: with feigned innocence, I asked him the reason for the spots. Papiah unbuttoned his collar and cuffs, showed me burn-marks all over: 'The neighbour's house was on fire with all the womenfolk trapped inside. In saving the life of one, I sustained the burns.' I persisted: 'But how did you save her? ' 'By pulling off her sari.' I pretended to be shocked; slightly nettled, he protested, 'What else could one have done in the situation? ' The topic ended there, with Papiah breaking into a violent cough.
'He's coughing his life away, can't you see, and yet the wretch knows no repentance. Each evening after work, he's back with his slut,' a fellow-driver
told me after a few months. That was the first time I realized he had consumption.
For the next six months Papiah reported regularly to work, though visibly weakened. Gossip was now his only companion: 'He doesn't send a pai home, squanders it all on his `keep.' But does she care? No Sir, not her. Even his wife refuses to see his face now,' A former friend of his affirmed in a conversation. When I enquired after his family, I was told by another: 'What can they do, Sir? they are begging by the roadside; yet, perhaps he has some land which his wife manages at home.' 'Why can't you reason with him? after all, you're his friend,' I ventured. 'Sir, he has no friends; I gave myself a headache trying to talk him out of his vices, but the fellow is adamant. He has completely lost his honour and reputation. Do you know that he spends his medicine allowance on liquor? He's half the size he used to be, spitting his life by the hour. He'll die soon, no better, surely than a stray dog in a gutter....'
Some weeks later, Papiah was confined to a sanatorium. My mother wrote off all the debts he had incurred for his medicines. The Management, too, was kinder to him,
paying his expenses without stinting. They even published a photo-feature on him in the house journal. The write-up was in English, a language he had never learned and I don't think he ever saw his picture. Papiah sank rapidly, dying soon after. The last comment he evoked was 'Poor man, he willed himself to death.'

Portrait Of A Lady
She was a small person in a big house stacked with objects d'art and other curiosities. She fancied herself a collector and, when coaxed to disclose her sources, never failed to mention her brushes with ex-royalty.
The drawing room had two large bongo-drums'Go ahead,' she breezed, 'they're for sitting'and two or three raucous and gaudy parakeets in cages. There must have been other noteworthy items that I did not notice. Adjacent to the drawing room was a hot house where exotic plants luxuriated in ultra violet light. I didn't see much point in it: it was warm enough outside. That brought the tour to an end, the kitchen and the bedrooms upstairs, being off limits.
At lunch she praised the ruling party and mentioned, in passing, that her cutlery was British and, yes, her crystal Belgian.
On the way out through the porch, we stopped to admire the imported Cadillac. At the gate, just beneath 'Beware of Dogs,' a copper-plated signboard announced three charitable trusts named after her: 'That's just for tax purposes,' she said carelessly, as she waved me goodbye with a flying kiss.

Prologue
Introductions, so they say, mustn't be too long; But I can't exactly promise to obey that law. There are, I take it, many texts in this post-structural age, In which introductions become interminable Because, quite simply, there's nothing to introduce, No main body, no inner chamber, no sanctum designate, Nowhere to lead into, nowhere to 'intro ducere': Just mazes, passages, and entrances, Decentred disseminations of differance. So these poems may lead nowhere but back to myself, Voices in my own consciousness seeking release and play. In that sense, isn't love an internal adjustment, The sport of Shiva and Shakti which leads to endless jouissance. If that's the case, there's only one love story, not many, And we all enact different versions of it. So much for the philosophical presuppositions of this text, None of which need be taken too seriously. Now to its artistic and aesthetic bases: These are harder far to ignore or neglect. Love poetry, everybody knows, has been written in all ages and climes, And starting a new love poem must necessarily induce An almost insurmountable anxiety of influence. Remember Jessica and Lorenzo in 'The Merchant of Venice', Those rather unimportant side-kicks to the protagonists? How even they recalled the whole prehistory of lovers When finally alone and face to face on a bright moonlit night: The lovers' list that they invoked, of Cressida and Troilus, Of Thisbe (and, by implication, Pyramus) , of Dido and Aeneas, Of Medea and Jason, is formidable enough and would be even longer, But for a timely interruption by the device of a Shakespearean messenger. So whom should I invoke? Our great poets, Kalidasa and Bharatrihari, Or the enduring tradition of the sport of Krishna, our greatest lover, Or, skipping centuries, should I remember such historical lovers As Prithviraj and Samyukta, or Shah Jehan and Mumtaz Mahal? Or legends such as Laila-Majnun, Shirin-Farhad, Heer-Ranjha? Or crossing centuries and epistemes again, meditate on Raj and NargisNot so much in real life as in the movies-or to bring myself up to date, Yash Chopra's latest fantasy, 'Chandani' enacted by inimitable Sridevi? The point is that all new love stories are grounded in older ones.
I wish, though, that this spiel on the intertextuality of love tales Would silence my own uncertainties and fears. Simply put, they are: what's so great about this love story? The lovers are neither rich, nor beautiful, nor glamorous: Both 'S' and 'M' are just ordinary, urban, bourgeois kids, So why celebrate their love? What's so special about them? Did they break the rules, create scandals, cheat on each other, Or were they star-crossed lovers doomed together? Or is their claim to celebrity and immortality Founded on some other outrageous and flamboyant perversity? The answers, I am afraid, are all in the negative: They're just like anyone else, nothing really to write poetry about. She studied in Lady Irwin College and he in St Stephen's. Though they were distantly related, they hadn't really met until then. They fell in love and went through the usual difficultiesAll this happened in Delhi in the late 1970's. Eventually, they got married in the USA. And after spending four or five years there they returned To India to take up respectable, but fairly mundane employment. After this, there is little to tell: in any case, Most of these biographical details are irrelevant to the poems. She turns thirty, not a very romantic age, But he falls in love with her againOr so he thinks he should like to believeAnd decides to celebrate the event By sending her thirty or nearly thirty poemsKama's arrowheads-and hence this collection. I have been very honest, this, dear reader, you cannot deny, Spelling out everything in a fairly straight forward way. In addition to all the usual problems of language, And the contradictions of the post-colonial age, There's nothing great about these poems, Nothing much to analyze or explicate: They have the usual influences-in this Prologue itself, For instance, you may find some Rushdie or SethTake your pick, but in any case, the style is cliche-ridden. If there are still a few things that I have left out The omissions can't be of much significance. As an English teacher, you know, I am always available for explanation or comment. But now, if you excuse me, I should get on to the main subject,
Which, as you by now know only too well, Is love, love, love-and if you'll accept my parting advice, Kindly forget all that I've said In what I realize has been a very prosaic preface.

Proposal
Mon cherie, this New Year's Eve, Let's get married, Again. I think the time is right for me to pop the question at last. Yes, thank you for waiting so long. The first time around, I wasn't quite ready. I was too young, too callow, Both of us were under stress, as you know. And the circumstances forced our decision. But now, I am in full possession of my bearings, Sound in mind and body, as they say, Settled in life, able to decide where my interests lie. And so, after considered reflection, I send you my proposal. You're pretty, you're well to do, you're highly eligible; What's more, your aura, which others can't see, Is spotlessly clean. I am fully satisfied That you're everything I want a woman to be. So: will you marry me? I don't know what I can offer in return; You decide, whether I meet your expectations or not. I can't promise that I will make you happy, But I shall try, with all my heart: To be true to you till death do us part.

Ps: Venus Serenus
She steps out of the frame Like Botticelli's venus from the giant scallop shell: But, of course, she's fully clad. She walks down two steps from the stage Of the college auditorium. Her silk sari unfreezes from its upturned swish As she descends, right foot forward, Stretched to make contact with the lower step. The left foot, except for the high-heel of her sandal, Remains hidden in the folds of the sari. Her right hand mirrors the graceful arch of her foot, Holding her sari up with a handkerchiefed fist, One glass bangle has slid on to her wrist, While the others still cluster on a smooth, tapering, forearm. In the other hand she holds a placard, With '89' printed in large figures on it. Her neck is bent forward, but the eyes look sideways and up, As if askance at me. The expression on the face is of uncomfortable puzzlement. Behind are three girls in bell-bottoms looking somewhere ahead. This picture of hers, circa 1977, Turns me on the most, Though I hadn't even met her then. The occasion: a mandatory fresher's parade On the last day of ragging in Lady Irwin College.
She's already coming down to join the audience When I pull her out of the photograph. How safe I have been so far, The ultimate voyeur, Watching her in complete security and immunity. How I imagine making love to her at seventeen, Mischievously thinking to myself, That all of her is mine-past, present, and future. The black blouse is tight over her firm breasts. The nipples point upwards, and I see that her bust Is not even fully formed yet. The face radiates innocence; Like Shakuntala in the hermitage,
She has been touched by no man. As I crush her small hand in mine, She utters a cry of surprise and pain: 'Who are you?' she screams, 'Let me go....' She wrenches herself from my grasp And struggles back into the photograph again.

Random Notes On Relationship
'It takes restraint to nurture a relationship. Haste and greed finish it quickly: you eat through all the good parts and then there's nothing left to relish.'
The would-be husband frowned upon my advice: looking at his lovely fiancée with mock-longing, he quipped: 'When I most long for her she'll quote these lines, as a shield against me.'
I thought of the logic of bourgeois marriages: demurely saying 'please wait' before; 'yes' only after the completion of all the paper workand never being able to say 'no' afterwards: how law, custom, and culture regulate the entrance to a woman's body.
The problem is in what we feel, not with what we do or don't: it's the emotions behind our actions that break hearts. The woman who touches another man can be taken back, &quot;forgiven&quot;; but what can you do when when she's stopped caring for you her heart empty or dead?
I used to believe that truth saves relationships and deception destroys them. But I realized too late that 'Human kind Cannot bear very much reality.' Perhaps, it's what we hide that keeps relationships while what we reveal terminates them.

College Days
In the grilled window overhead Before ringing the bell I see your face. It is only love, nothing else.
You rush down the stairs You hold my hand, Your cheeks flushed with excitement. It is only love, nothing else.
We sit on the lawn In cushioned wicker chairs. The night queen exudes its scent. It is only love, nothing else.
You smile at me, I lean over, The world blurs out of focus again. It is only love, nothing else.
At the sound of the car We hastily disengage, You rearrange your hair. It is only love, nothing else.

Then, your parents suspect. They inspect your mail, They take counter measures. It is only love, nothing else.
We meet elsewhere Whispering in dingy cafes, Under the waiter's suspicious gaze. It is only love, nothing else.
Or else outside your college, Or on a park bench,
Or in a shopping centre on a weekend. It is only love, nothing else.
On your birthday, before the final exam, You lie you're at a friend's place, We meet in an expensive restaurant. It is only love, nothing else.
In the dim light you say We can't go on like this. In silence I stare ahead. It is only love, nothing else.
*** At last it is time to graduate. You hold my last letter, Now smudged, tightly to your chest. It is only love, nothing else.
What will become of me, you wail, My throat catches too, The sari slips off your heaving breasts. It is only love, nothing else.
In a flash, all the memoriesLetters, phone calls, innumerable meetingsDart by as we watch, helpless. It is only love, nothing else.
You resist my caress, at first But suddenly yield, with vehemence. It is to be our last embrace. It is only love, nothing else.
I leave town. You settle down, Marrying somebody else. It is only love, nothing else.

Routine
A dark, handsome woman, worn out with child bearing and a wisp of a girl, in a torn frockthey move in unison as they walk to work, mother and daughter, sharing intimate whispers, barefoot, tinkling anklets, at the break of dawn. At the sound of the car, the daughter turns, transfixed. It is a shining new sedan and its colour hurts the eyes in the early morning light. It passes smartly, crunching the gravel underneath. Gently, the mother draws the child away and urges her on to the daily routine.

Separation In An Art Film
What a clatter she made As she moved about the house, Wracked. With sharp sounds She worked her way through the shelves, Disturbing his books. He stood Still and watched as they toppled All over the floor. She began to To pull out her clothes, snapping hangers, Tearing and clutching at the stuffed shelves. The trinkets accumulated over the years, Most of them his gifts, spilled out awkwardly, Displaying the ravages of the years. Then came the knick-knacksPerfumes, lipsticks, other women's things. Still she moved about noisily: What else was hers and hers alone? These years had blurred the distinctions. There was no way to make a clean getaway: Stuffing everything into a suitcase, Zipping it up smartly, and then walking out, Triumphant, as in other movies. Here Everything was going to be messy and painful. Every little item, every possession, had its Own memory, embalmed by their joint Ownership; now each thing that had Cemented their relationship had to be violated Individually. And for years to come they Would relive, in their own separate ways, The agony of that day when they broke Into two.

She And He
To be a woman is to be silent and sure To know, to be secure, Not just about oneself but about the world, About what's good and what's bad, What to hold and what to void. To be a woman is to be strong, Not by becoming strong, not by acquiring strength: To be a woman is to be strength itself. To be a woman is not to speculate, Not to know separation from the self, Not to know death. To be a woman is to find one's depth within oneself. To be a woman is never to venture, Never to stray, never to search, But to have, as natural right, Dominion over the earth. To be a woman is to hold sway, To be a woman is to be the source.
To be a man is to seek, to venture, to defineAnd to find one's annihilation in woman.

Some Comic Relief At The End
Kunwar Mattu Singh, Prince of Wails, Woke up to find he'd got the blues again. When his courtiers cried, '_Yuvraj ki Jai ho!_' He sighed, 'I wanna my Soju.'
Reluctantly he brushed his teeth, Mounted his golden potty in vain, When his scented bath was ready, He merely pouted, 'I wanna my Soju.'
To his breakfast he was coaxed, The table laden with his favourite dishesPuris and gulab jamuns among countless other sweetums and fryums; Instead he demanded, 'I wanna my Sojlums.'
Finally, he was dressed: gold sherwani over brocade pants Clinging to his skinny frame. The herald announced: '_Ba adab, ba mulaiza hoshiyaar, Kunwar Mattu Singh padhaar rahe hain_...' He entered the court, declared: 'I wanna my Soju.'
Somehow the day dragged on, Mattu Singh transacted his usual business, But every now and then, in the midst of the proceedings, He burst out and said, 'I wanna my Sojlums.'
In the evening, at the entertainment, Several dancing girlies, those enchanting houries, Tried to entice him out of his gloominess: He frowned and explained, 'I wanna my Soju.'
At nightfall, he couldn't sleep. Spurning the ministrations of his handmaidens, He sulked and wept in bed: 'I only wanna my Sojulums.'
When the crown prince began to waste and pine away, At last, Her Royal Highness and His Majesty, Emperor of Tearland, Sighland, and Wails, Themselves groaned, 'Give him his Soju.'
But who was this Soju? Was she a fairy or an elf That had stolen Mattu's heart and flown away? Mattu Singh only reiterated, 'I wanna my Sojlums.'
So far and wide in the vales of separation Royal messengers were dispatched to investigate: Let's end this tale of tears, they resolved, Let's find Mattu his Sojlums.
Will the kingdom of Wails Like the communist parties in Eastern Europe, Dissolve itself? Will the lovers be united? Will Mattu Singh get his Sojlums?
You decide, gentle reader, how the tearjerker ends; I'll only mention the bounty announced by the King's messengers: Those who help in reuniting Soju and Mattu will attain Success in love and life and peace afterwards.

Stone And Flesh
They were two: Petrified, wide-eyed, Staring straight ahead, Neither laughing nor crying At the daily round of worship; Cymbals, bells, lamps, incense, recitations. She said: Beloved, Isn't it boring to be fixed here forever, Neither moving nor participating in the spectacle? When the thought issued from her mind He became conscious of himself, Entrapped though in stone. In a trice, They escaped into the world, And were lost in its hubbub.
She wept bitterly, Large drops rolling down her cheeks. Again, he struck her; she screamed: Both abused each other, Lamenting over their loss of happiness. Surrounding them, like the walls of a prison, Was the humdrum sordidness of poverty: The state of perpetual want, The feeling, which never quite left them, Of dreams unfulfilled, wishes unsatisfied. And the gradual degradation that circumstances bring.
Suddenly, he awoke, as if from a nightmare: What are we doing here, my dear? Shouldn't we be over there, In the consoling darkness of the sanctum? In a flash they disappeared, Back to their original places Wide-eyed and squat, Staring ahead meaninglessly: Two stone idols.

Survivors
At the end of fifty-five or sixty years after one has retired, and lives quietly, in seclusion, one's children far away, with their own claims and concerns, the weight of the bygone years suddenly oppresses one with the arrival of a stray postcard from a son in another country: a picturesque beach far away evokes memories of one's childhood in a coastal village half a century ago, and fills the mind with an unspeakable sorrow. The dark deserted beach the swish of the wind the roar of the sea the smell of the surf and little brown boys, playing in the sun. The smiles and sounds come back as if from another life.
I read father's reply and know that I too was thereand through many such spent lifetimes I shall survive, holding to my chest a millennia of the collective memories of my race.

The Bitter Half
I never liked you, remember that; But like an miser, I clung to my faults.
If we didn't jive, I can't blame you, It's I who had difficulties with your idea of love.
You were touchy, you were vindictive, you were self-righteous. Yes, you not I, were in love.
I know I cannot fault you for not setting me free. Hearts once given aren't retrieved easily.
How soon young love becomes a fetter: When you're fast, you can't be free.
We've been together for thirteen years; If not the best, you've given me the worst years of your life.
I can be heartless, I admit it: It's my way of saving myself from your soft-heartedness.
They say a girl becomes a woman at thirty; If so, after some confused rock and roll, show me how you waltz.

The Dance
The rain-dance required prior permission from Mother. IN the tiled courtyard in the middle of the house, Gleefully shedding our clothes--those encumbrances-- We two brothers would assemble. Then frisking and romping in the showers We would yell for our neighbours upstairs (Sisters of five and seven with rhyming names) To join us, splashing about a great deal To make our invitation attractive.
Then, with bated breaths we awaited the outcome Of the artful badgering of our peers, Considering that their father was out, and Conniving to use the occasion To bathe her daughters thoroughly, Aunty upstairs would reluctantly grant permission.
I danced till my limbs failed Or it stopped raining, Scarcely realizing that the image of two immature girls, Soaped from head to toe, dancing wildly, Slowly washed by the rain to pink nakedness Would follow me across the gulf of puberty Into the wet dreams of an uneasy adolescence.

The Love Poem Unwritten
The poem he wished to write began this way: Is it come to this That I am reduced to writing love poems To you....
There he stopped. A heavy onus Of unresolved emotions Seemed to gag him. He wished to say: How ironic it was that separation Had revived their love, How she still defined his existence By absence, as she had once done Through her presence; How distance generated intimacy, So that now they were in love again. And how corny, how odd, how unusual that felt. Like nothing they'd felt before, In fact, almost like in the movies, Their romance was beginning to dramatize itself. Yes, this was the intoxication Of not just being in love, But of being in love with being in love. He wanted to say: I love you. I love myself when I love you. I love what you do to me. I love what my love does to you. When I think of us, there's a tremor Not in my heart, but in the pit of my stomach, It's a dull fire that spreads upwards, From my loins. It's a hormonal high When I remember how we lie side by side, Naked, and how we make love. Unlike the past, now we don't even need foreplay. We are so hot just being next to each other. And we are so serene when we join, We even talk and smile. But as I push into you, in, in, in, All words are stuck in the throat. I feel myself dissolving into you,
My self sinking lower and lower, To vanishing point. By entering you, I give you back to yourself. There you are, your face flushed, but calm. And then there's neither you nor me, But only a warmth, throbbing and vital, Which says: Love, love, love, Or Om, Om, Om-just the primordial note. We look at each other like this, And an eternity passes away As time forgets itself.
He wanted to say: Now that we're apart once again, I think, how strange it is to be in love And to write about one's love, To write poems to you, Telling you how much I miss you, How I am pining away, And yet how delicious the pain is, How exciting, inviting, welcome. To reinvent language to say all this To call back to oneself the sighs and tremors Of love, to talk of your eyes and lips, To celebrate your face, to get lost In your fragrant tresses, to seek refuge In the shade of your eyelashes, to praise The softness and warmth of your touch, To talk of the scent of your breath, To remember your intimate gestures, To cup your breasts in my hands Like two panting doves, To nestle my face between them, And to remember all the noises you make, And how you clown around, making faces, And how we invent silly names for each other... To talk about all this and much more. In words, words, words, to project myself at you. Then after this burst of verbal energy, fear: To think that the person I am in love with Is not you, but something that I have created myself, An image of what I love. To think that I have made
An idol of you which in my loneliness I adore. And how such love fills me with both Ecstasy and dread, lest you interrupt these effusions, Breaking through the image, declaring Your real self, shattering the mirror of dreams. How all this fits in with the poetry reading In which I read love poems to you, Thus becoming a poet in love, Wooing you with my poems, Making public our passion, And in the process, making you my dream, my love, my muse, Always passive, the recipient of all this homage, The silent deity to which the priest-poet Lights his lamps, pouring out his devotion. And so the recurrent fear: It's so easy to love one's own creation, But how difficult to love a real person. O God, how scared I am of loving you.
He wanted to write all this, But how awkward and unconvincing it sounded, And a silent onus seemed to gag him. He felt saddened at his inability to love. He thought: being in love is easy, But to love someone so difficult. He wondered if he could ever love, If there was any hope for him, If his heart heart would melt, If he would be saved. How important it was to find love: It was the perfume of existence; And life was arid without it. He examined himself and his own life, His compulsions to write, To project things, to become something else, To alter life, to change reality, Always the drive, the ceaseless flow of words, words, words. And now, the onus on his heart, The inability to write, to express His stirring love for his own wife, The inability to force all this into words, The fear of being found out as a liar,
The anxiety of being exposed and branded, The dread of discovering his own changeability, To find out, alas, that he couldn't, didn't, Was unable to love, to love her.
At last he wrote: There are those who love; And there are others who only write poems. It is you who love; And I only write poems.
Did he then realize The simple release of love And the bitter doom of having to write only poems?

The Magic Lantern
In the darkened room, The improvised slide show was rigged up. One of the walls, in pale pastel, Served as the screen. At the other end, Besides the bed, I was put in charge Of the old projector. A battered cardboard box Overflowing with slides was dumped beside me'There, see whatever you like...' The others huddled nearby, pulling up Chairs from the dining room.
You were such a chubby baby, A real cuteums and cuddleums Just like those fat and contented babies On Lactogen tins. In your father's Arms, you looked like a smug kitten, And 'Kaka,' as you insisted on calling your father, Himself was so handsome in his tweeds, Almost like a film star. He had those smooth Appealing looks.
There you are, a brat of five or six With a mad gleam in your eyes, hair dishevelled. Both sisters, framed in their mischief, like Two little monkeys. No wonder, you still Break into giggles once in a while: You always had that lunatic fringe.
Here are a few family portraits-some common aunts Ranged together with their babies. There's my Mother, behind, looking very pregnant, Yes, it was me she was carryingAnd there you are, a baby again, Nestling in the arms of your mom.
Our parents look marvelously young and energetic, So confident, so full of life. And you and your cousins look grumpy and cross Alike, as you sit on the terrace Of your grandmother's house in Pune.
The slide show ends abruptly: The power's failed again. I draw The curtains aside and observe an altered world. All your cousins are married now, With children of their own. I marvel at the passage of time and generations... Are our lives going to be all that different?
Well, we had to stop reviewing the past Before you reached adolescence. Your father said, 'Anyway, there aren't many slides of the the girls Grown up. I lost interest, you see. and the hobby had become too expensive...' So are we overtaken by life at some point That we no longer have the luxury Of sitting back and recording the passage of time.
Sharing your childhood has been a rather spooky Privilege: an intimacy almost incestuous. And rather silly thoughts arise in my mind Unawares: 'So, all along you were growing up For me, to be mine! '
Guiltily, I look around And observe the furrowed faces Of your parents, whose lives are now So many framed negatives in the box. Our parents... they are all old now, Their generation has moved up into The senior citizen's slot, leaving the ambiguous Pride of place to us. In them I see our future Just as in their past is our present.
We have extended our relationship back Into childhood, before puberty and sexuality. Romance and passion pass away: This, our present relationship Is therefore not the norm, but merely a phase. Yet this is what the world calls love, And celebrates so exhaustively. I realize, inadvertently, that our ties are Deeper far... and then cleverly, I begin
To create a mythology for us. You were Born, and then you called me down....
In your absence, you home has yielded Its secrets to me one by one. While Your mom and dad sleep in their bedroom, I lie awake in your room on your childhood bed, Possessed in more ways than one, by you.

Compatible Incompatibility
After all, what's the worst thing that I can say About you and our marriage? It is this: I don't love you - cannot, the way I want to love A woman; and that we are incompatible, by nature Utterly different from one another; finally, That we'll never really be happy, together. After having said the worst, I immediately begin to feel better: The only way now is up. And I try to rationalize away my hurt; We cannot live up to anyone else's standards Of love, happiness, or compatibility. It's best to leave these women's magazine issues, And get on with our own lives, Figuring out our own way. Till we can agree, let's follow this simple rule: You do what you like, I do what I; And sometimes we can do it together. Let us be true to each other By being true to ourselves; Let us find strength in our weakness. Because, hey darling, don't you see That as long as you can still hurt me, I'll never be able to leave you.

The Night By Moonlight
The night welcomed him with open arms and gradually divulged all her plans.
A full moon, he coasted into her heart and floated out of her dark, delighted eyes.
Gently, he brushed her roving depths, a cheek-stroking feather of light,
a cloud floating through the air carrying the burden of moonshine.
Intrigued, she asked him who he was but only her shadow mocked back at her.
Suddenly, she understood: the night does not define the moon; the moon gives shape
to the night. Content, she went limp and gave up her plans; approvingly, he smiled.
In the morning, seeing the vacant bed, she cried out, 'Oh, he's gone....'
But the bright sunshine revealed that it was herself she couldn't find.

The Second Time Is The Best
Falling in love the first time is a dream It's like an unanchored boat swept away at high tide: There's no time to think or reconsider: Venture in haste, repent at leisure. Mud castles are not protected by walls of grit: Before you know it the current undercuts the defences, And in you plunge, headlong, heedless of your self.
Falling in love again and again is a recurring nightmare. How many loves can one change? How many false trials sustain? Each gesture now becomes corrupt: Hands soiled with dung, eyes degraded with lust. You wander thirsty and starving in the howling winds Like a lunatic lost among mirages in the desert.
But falling in love the second time is the bestNot with anyone else, but with your first love. That's like entering paradise with open eyes: The gradual ascent of the sun, The rise of nectar from the ocean, The slow, clear, hard, and heady intoxication, The easy sliding into throbbing ecstasy; Ripe fruit, sweet and firm, cut cleanly, easily eaten.

The Seven Year Itch
On a conference abroad he tried to have his fling; But his date said instead, good luck in your married life.
He narrated a whole epic of subliminal motives and unconscious drives; She said, relax, we haven't even begun to kiss.
He thought she would offer herself to be rejected by him. How vain to think that any woman could be so self-deluding.
A lot of romance in two or three days, experience without responsibility; Only men, not women, harbour such fantasies.
Like his wife she was spontaneous, small, and pretty; But she was also virtuous and sent him back packing.
They spent so long sitting up, talking, The next morning found them in separate beds, sleeping soundly.
When he joked about the harmlessness of little indiscretions; The alarm in her eyes confirmed that she valued her chastity.
The bar remained open till 2:00 AM; there was gossip, then sex; But he said his prayers as usual and went to bed at 10:00 PM.
His compatriot, who made it with the Italian chick, said he'd slept early; He realized with dismay that without lying you can't even commit adultery.
She promised to write to him, but of course never did. He had made no promises, but in revenge, wrote this poem.

Violet
She sat in her glass office like a little bird in a cage, slight and wispy haired. I was a flustered foreigner looking for a place to stay: 'You'll like it,' she volunteered, 'the food, for one, is excellent. I can vouch for it because I eat breakfast and lunch here.' She looked at me kindly and stubbed her cigarette.
Every morning on my way to breakfast, I would pause by her office and say, ''Morning Violet,' to which she replied, 'Well, good morning. How are you today?' Then we would make small talk usually discussing the weather or her health. Before leaving I would say, 'Have a good day, Violet,' in the newly acquired American way.
So a semester passed. Having other friends now, I discontinued my daily courtesy. Once, seeing me slink past her office, she called, and began talking excitedly before noticing that I wasn't particularly interested. Then, to my tongue-tied shame came the moment of recognition when she perceived my indifference. I clumsily wished her good day but could not escape the hurt slowly creeping into her eyes.
Having resolved never to slight her again thereafter I again began to greet Violet faithfully every day. On Fridays we would wish each other a good weekend,
resuming our conversations, on Mondays. In this manner, snow-fall succeeded leaf-fall. As the weather worsened Violet coughed badly complaining more than usual about her health. I tried to coax her into quitting smoking, but though she refrained in my presence, the full ashtray always gave her away.
At the end of the spring semester I moved into my own apartment. Our parting was brief and hurried. A few days later I saw her at the street corner, for the first time outside her office. She wore a blue coat, with a chiffon scarf primly tied under her chin. I had never realized how frail she was. Her back was turned to me and I was heading in another direction, so I left her waiting there, without exchanging a word.
Two weeks later I was standing by Violet's glass window anticipating the pleasure of meeting her. Her chair was empty as if she had stepped out for a minute: (I half looked for the 'Will be back in five minutes' sign.) The door opened. An unfamiliar face advanced: 'May I help you?' A bit unsettled, I blurted: 'Where's Violet?'
She had no family, few friends, very little money. She lived alone; wanted to die before becoming helpless. Her church had started a collection to pay for the funeral: did I wish to contribute?
I cared for the living, but felt no pangs for the dead. Violet died of lung cancer. So sudden her departureI was vaguely betrayed. 'She didn't tell me,' I thought, 'she went away without letting me wish her good day.'

Walls
In the sultry darkened hotel room I lost my innocence. Our touch solidified into a wall It separates us now We can't scale it. The privileged uptight seam Eats into the warmth between your legsHow will it feel If I palm you gently there? Will your thigh-stubble tickle? You dress to tempt To provoke undress: The forthright curve of your waist, The assertive thrust of your breast Are both suspect. You smile, cleverly Appropriate borrowed smells. I carry them away Oppressed. Within my palms your face grew cold. We slobbered, hairs enmeshed; Tongues turned reptiles The saliva strung our distances with silvery tentacles. You wiped your lips on my chest And I turned my face away. Still we held each other fast. You said it was easier this way Here was a bond Real, palpable Our wall We could huddle by it. How could every meeting be a new beginning, How could we assay anew, Keeping fresh vigil each time? So, I have learnt all the cues now. I play my part with ease I have marked smaller spaces In which to be myself. There, imprisoned beyond your reach
I grope against our wall And call for you incessantly.

What She Taught Him

Among other things, to be as good as possible, and never explain oneself afterwards; to wait, wait, wait, till it hurts but humbly receive what's freely given; to share as much as possible only if he didn't regret it later; always in love to be natural, not planning obsessively for the future. Never to expect the other person to be true, even to her promises; likewise, never to give excuses or reasons for his behaviour with her; never to indulge in recriminations or be vindictive when it's over; always, to be prepared for the end even when so much is left unfinished; to be grateful for what life offers, and never push one's luck-above all, to live with uncertainty, and, if possible, enjoy it.

Wife

She came into my life Bearing all the auspicious marks Like, aeons ago, the daughter of the mountains did.
When I beheld her first, She opened herself to me Like a lotus aroused by the sun.
Her giving was so complete That my narrow heart Was too frightened to understand and accept her.
I treated her cruelly Trying to prove her false, Hoping she'd set me free.
By degrees she lost her softness And became hard and adamant. I raised my hand on her, but couldn't bend her will.
The battle lines were drawn, It would be a long fight. Even the gods stood by to watch the outcome.
As the contest began, All my austerities paled into insignificance: One tear from her eye tipped the scales in her favour.
My guru said 'Don't think you can get there on your own: Without her, you have no salvation.'
Still I chafed, uncomfortable. My love had become a yoke, A goad with which she drove my elephantine ego.
Often, I tried to accept my lot: My lips said all the right words, But my cold heart did not thaw.
I looked for ways to make life easier. Let's make a deal, I offered Let's forget about love and settle for happiness.
Before she could spurn me, I realized that again I had betrayed myself: The original terms of the contract specified love.
As the years dragged on She filled my days with unhappiness, Stirring not an inch from her original position.
And in the beginning It was I who had boasted That to bear fruit, the penance must be severe.
Self-cursed, I marvelled at my loss: How beautiful she was, But though my own, how inaccessible.
To imagine that I had it all And yet had nothing: My own renunciations were eating into my heart.
What paradoxical emotions I experienced: I hated her but when she turned her face away, The world became a wilderness.
Hot, dry winds blew And I roamed about like a madman, Bereft, thirst, gasping for breath.
Truly, she was the world, Society, life, all that made existence meaningful; Without her I could only destroy the universe.
Elders and well-wishers watched this relationship Baffled and frightened: The terrific battles over trifles and unspoken assent over vitals.
With others we were the best behaved But with each other, Fierce critics, exacting and unforgiving.
They advised us: it looks so bad To see you fighting; At least behave yourself in public.
But, secretly, I felt sure: When it looks worse than it is, there's still hope; But when it looks good but is rotten inside, that's the end.
Thus, we were always stronger than we looked; We always loved each other more Than we cared to admit.
Now I have learned That she doesn't ask for much: With whatever is offered, nothing less than my heart.
Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking She's only too human: she behaves as she pleases, does what she wants; She never gives up anything for me.
But before her austerity, my renunciations Wither like stale flowers: the woman who can be celibate In her matrimonial bed, is verily an image of the Divine Mother.
At last in a vision I saw who she was, Enveloped in a flood of white light, As a divine child sporting in the empyrean.
When I looked into her mind It was like a spring of crystal water, Sparkling and spotless-without a speck of dirt.
To have her for wife is indeed a blessing. Her very thought drives away sin: She is both Guru and _Gruhini_.
So, Love, I return myself to you As in the end of all beginnings: I pray to you: open my heart, give me another chance.
May my words please you well, May you open your eyes and smile, And hold up your hand in benediction.
In you are contained all that is noble, In you is all auspiciousness: Health, bounty, happiness, the abundance of creation.
To make you happy is to please the gods, To hurt you, to cause you the slightest pain, Is to invite misfortune with one's own hands.
You are _vidya_, you are _shanti_, you are _dhriti_, You are _keerti_, you are _rati_, you are _sati_, So bless me-give me refuge at your feet.
And let our home resonate With the harmonies of peace and joy And let the earth itself flower with your benediction.
This gift of love, let us share Like the spiritual fragrance of the yagnas of yore, Until we disappear once more, returning to our permanent abodes.
So victory to righteousness; death to wickedness; Peace to the denizens of the earth; And salvation to all, from particle to God.

In the city of sin the dizzy wheel spun twirling glittering talons of light. He closed his burning eyes, raw lids squeezed out the tears and in the hot, pale glow within appeared the faces of those he loved.
The smooth deck spilled, splashing blood, toppling the pile of white chips. In the polished surface beneath he saw strangers stripping his palaces, strangers driving his chariots, strangers sifting the leftovers.
The cunning wheel stopped the crimson knave laughed and in the distance slowly, the gathering scavengers stirred.

Epilogue (As An Old-Fashioned Homily)
At the end of my labour A familiar voice consoles me in intimate whispers: Don't worry, honey, you haven't erred In this public celebration of our love. The great monuments to love like the Taj Mahal, Transformed private emotions into social ritual. No grand passion can be contained Within secret diaries or letters But must spill out sooner or later into the open. Love, like money, must be shared, Not hoarded: so it can multiply. To broadcast love, therefore, is no crime. But beware of making it an act A stunt to gain cheap publicity or praise.... Before she admonishes me further, I stop her mouth with half a dozen kisses. The rest of her warnings Become silly mumblings inside my head. But now I'd better make a quick getaway Before I am hooted out by my audience, And though not vain enough to think (like John Donne) That our love can serve as an example, Let me just say, dear reader, that if someone loves you, Be they fair or plain, don't let go of them: You won't get such chances again and again. But if for some reason you cannot reciprocate, Treat them gently, release them with tenderness, Remembering Bulleh Shah's wise pronouncement: Break a temple or a mosque, But don't break a heart full of love. For, as the good book saith, the greatest of all is Love.

Eyes
All the cliches in love poetry, it turns out, are true. Eyes have sex organs and sex organs have eyes.
As Ma Ananda Sheela said of Rajneesh: He didn't sleep with me, but he was a man of my eyes.
From across the room, her eyes made mouths at him; But she discovered that she was moist between her legs.
Without saying anything she did it all with him; Women are like that, he thought, silent but devastating.
He did nothing to her, but she still squirmed uncomfortably; Eyes, not hands, should be clean.
With mounting pleasure her lids dimmed gradually; When the eye of love opens, the other shuts automatically.
When she said, exasperated, but I have only two eyes, How conveniently one forgets oneself, he thought shamelessly.

Food For Thought
The sky has darkened before its time: a swarm of locusts, not a thunder-storm.
To protect my tender crops I build foolish fires, burning everything handy. The smoke drives some away, kills some. The rest descend. Hosts of them camp in my head. Frenzied, I run about, stamping the earth with bare heels. I shout, clapping bits of tin to distract the devouring.
When there is a famine within we shan't go completely hungry: we'll heap all the dead words and cook them. It is said they are delicious with rice and lentils.

257,"A Poem In Which She Remembers

'We were not lovers, we were love.'--Jeannette Winterson
The woman you once knew will not own up to her face.
She'll tie her hair in a topknot, guard its million tangles, skip kohl that once defined her eyes, forsake the gypsy jewellery, milk cigarettes in her mouth, and stop herself from dancing in the rain.
She'll curse her restless anklets that break the silence of cruel days, bury herself under a blanket that betrays the shame of night hungers, and sleep herself to a dream of waking by your side.
She'll write you the daring first lines of long love-letters she will never send, struggle to prevent a poem from forming within her mouth, and in its place, feed the promises of your kisses to her eager tongue.

Composition

At that brief time When you wait For the audacious cane To strike your skin, And the rest of you is flinching And cringing, with part shame, And part pain, Poetry dictates itself In your mind. Short lines Rip through, like bullets From a machine gun.
The poem comes with the Freshness of a life set free, Whistling its way, Painfully, like wind searing Through the palm fronds.
Then,
The cane thrashes Your skin, dancing cruelly And bouncing in wooden joy. Before you scream, Or shake, the poetry stops. And the Muse, is tentatively, Laid to rest, much before the Composition is Complete.

Dead Woman Walking

i am a dead woman walking asylum corridors, with faltering step, with felted, flying hair, with hollowed cheeks that offset bulging eyes, with welts on my wrists, with creasing skin, with seizures of speech and song, with a single story between my sobbing, pendulous breasts.
once i was a wife: beautiful, married to a merchant: shifty-eyed. living the life, until he was lost in listless doubt-- of how, what i gave him was more delicious than whatever, whatever had been given to me. his mathematics could never explain the magic of my multiplying love--this miracle-- like materializing mangoes out of thin air, like dishing out what was never there.
this discrepancy drove him away: a new job in another city. he hitched himself to a fresh and formless wife. of course, as all women do, i found out.
i wept in vain, i wailed, i walked on my head, i went to god.
i sang in praise of dancing dervishes, i made music for this world to devour on some dejected day. i shed my beauty, i sacrificed my six senses. some called me mad, some called me mother but all of them led me here, to this land of the living-dead.

Evil Spirits

You are possessed. Witch doctors believe in phantoms, that cause your illness. But, driving out devils can be challenging. Spirits are given away--

And because ghosts and ghouls obey your rules, they leave you to come to us. Is this `transference'? An unofficial appeasement. We become inhabited by the dead, who ruins our doomed lives. Demons in our bodies are brutal tenants and frequently,
They suck with their vampire tongues to drink our anemic blood -- leave their puncture marks, which can be faintly seen on our black skins; skins that bear greater scars, reminders of larger, human cruelty...
Anyway, there isn't a lot of life in our bodies. We are souls. Wandering souls. Still, once Ghost-tasted, we rot away. We rot away. Remember, rotting is a long procedure... Day by day, we grow coffin cold and slowly Life creeps out, a lazy earthworm. At last, we die.

Lead him into the land Of silences--Ignore his words of praise Where all the perfidy hides...

Because the climax of a dream Is its return to reality, let him cling To your laughter, to your eyes that shine of light...
***
Make him study the gilt of gold Against the wan brown of your skin but let him choose...
***
Exhibit your flawless arms Dearest child of 1984--no vaccination mark Nothing to remind him of his Maari or small pox...
***
Lead him to count the moles On your skin but force him to begin With the beauty spot above your lips...
***
Talk to him of that summer of chickenpox That left you almost unscathed, but show him The unbeautiful gash where metal seared eight-year skin...
***
Tell him the history of your Raphunzel hair That tickled your shins. And of a cruel world that sapped You, so your hair cannot reach down to cover your shame...
***
Press his ears against your skin And hear him announce--the dance Is in the bones, the dance is in the blood...
***
He shall chart and plot And map, but shrewd girl Bring him up to worship you...
***
Allow him to memorize all of you So that, some day, he shall ravish you Screaming fiery love-words in your mother-tongue...

Facing The Music

Your lover was lynched For one of those readily available reasons.
Too weak for suicide, too mute for murder You live. Post-traumatically, poetically. You live as if he has never died.
Shell-shocked, spellbound, your third eye Clamped shut to keep the nightmare away, Your blood bears the salt of withheld tears. Never do you mention that your man--so alive Even when being set alight--was humbled Into handfuls of ash and defiant bones.
You turn deaf to face this faulty music, You sacrifice all sleep to live this fragile dream. You've sworn to never let him wander out of sight. You hold him captive in your shattered, Unwavering world and he, like a flame, Ceaselessly flickers, so your eyes too dance, And your moonglow in his ghostly presence Makes poets sing of how, once upon a time, Beauty basked in the light of her undying Love.

Here they are: the dream-chasers, the fire-stampers: Souls in sweaty soles, the flaming bare feet Of men and women (and also, those between) .
Here, the blood-splattered, whip-wrapped ones, flaunting starry, self-flagellation scars.
Hollering here, the flashes of mortified flesh-- steel hooks piercing stretched skin; skewers drilled through trembling tongues, sometimes bridging cheeks, sometimes sealing lips.
Here, the hearts beat in answer to hysterical drumming. Here, the bleeding is blessed.
And here, for Maari, the pain is prayer enough.

It is for those who can bear to leave A mass of their waste, the dregs of their glory. O, it is for the selfish who seek to burn through a medium.

Words tightly wrapped, and imprisoned in a cluster of highlighter colours, share my slavery. Rattling loud, the colorized intrusions have pickled the past, leaving me to savour saturation. Oh hell, even my treasured dreams have been bleached away in shades of three, or five.
Save me, from this unbearable starkness of fluorescence; where lines rehash the pages brutally, moving with sounds of spectacled scrutiny. For, all that I can bear to comprehend is the loss of dare: my sheltered cowardice. And, the sole comfort I crave, through stifled tears is stolen love beneath stained glass windows.

How They Prostitute A Poem

It is uniquely easy For some to sell Ideals because Business of absent Goods is essentially A sacrosanct but mostly A flimsy transaction.
Some learn, early on, To prostitute their verse. So, in all the waking hours They scavenge for a simple simile That matches requirements, fulfills needs.
They barter reality And every romance To a blurred triplicate Carbon-copy World of Hard Cash and Price Tags and Brand Names.
In this brothel Of stilled hope and Stagnated stories, poems Are born virgin and endowed With voluptuous figures of firm, Full breasts and wide hips where men Prefer to plant their pastime dreams, Or conceive their seed, Or merely spite themselves, Or dabble at domination.
But, the poem, with this Bogus existence becomes An adept, untiring prostitute.

Haunting oppressors to shave their heads. Cutting all their holy threads.

women and men wrote their songs of love the intimacies of inside
and they spoke of how love was tireless love was a fantasy feast love was no disease love was no evil goddess love was a harshness, in the parting love was
`the thing that made a girl's bangles slip loose when her lord went away grow tight when her lord returned' love was (they sang) `bigger than the earth higher than the sky unfathomable than the waters.' love was.
no names were named. you did not know
who he was or who she was or when it was or where it was only love was.
and there were the poems of war, the war poetry poems on the outside
(and perhaps because the bards wore lotuses of gold)
there are the poems where the names were named where the kings were praised where a bard addressed another where the guide sang to the patron where the poet sang to the courtesan where mothers spoke of tigers in their wombs where the kingdom was
`an unfailing harvest of victorious wars' where the old women `threatened to slash their breasts if their sons died in battle with backs turned in fright' where the end spoke of `the blood glowing in the red center of the battlefield like the sky before nightfall'

I stand up and ask, What does that bird do on new moon nights? Peeved by what she thinks is impudence, The teacher says the bird watches my face. The class turns all at once, stares at me. Ashamed, I shrink, I sit.
Twenty-two, lost in any space, I restlessly seek the strength Of his shoulders and I hunt Like a hungry beast to catch a glimpse Of my coal-black lover, and I crave to look once more Into his limitless eyes where I sank and never surfaced.
As I desolately count each passing hour, I become that moon-gazing bird on new moon nights, I sing the saddest songs of all time, I never ask questions...

She thought she was dying--ants crawled under her flaking skin, migraines visited her at mealtimes, her tender-as-tomato breasts bruised to touch, her heart forgot its steady beat. Floundering at forty, she twisted safety pins into spirals, chewed on pencil-ends, tore down calendars, became a hurricane about the house. That wetness, with its lunar reek, never came.
Her monthly drip had disappeared. Her no-money man was back home by then-- ditched and duped by his dancer mistress. She forgave that bitch, buried the bad blood between, gave him her anklet of rubies to sell and begin some business with. He went. A week later, she received his body bag With the executioner's seal on the toe tag.
She stormed the palace, flung her other anklet at the bloody throne. The royals too saw the red. The king died of shame, the queen died of shock. On the edge, Ms. Militancy bayed for more blood. Vending vengeance, she made a bomb of her left breast and blew up the blasted city. Long after that land had turned to ashes, the rest of her plucked breast bled.
Watching that breast sprout back from its roots, the lone woman learnt to outgrow her loss. When the scars no longer showed and the faraway sea could be smelt between her legs, she dissolved in a mist of aftersmoke.

My Lover Speaks Of Rape

Flaming green of a morning that awaits rain And my lover speaks of rape through silences, Swallowed words and the shadowed tones Of voice. Quivering, I fill in his blanks.
Green turns to unsightly teal of hospital beds And he is softer than feathers, but I fly away To shield myself from the retch of the burns Ward, the shrill sounds of dying declarations,
The floral pink-white sad skins of dowry deaths.
Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .
Colorless noon filters in through bluish glass And coffee keeps him company. She chatters Away telling her own, every woman's story; He listens, like for the first time. Tragedy in
Bridal red remains a fresh, flushing bruise across Brown-yellow skinscapes, vibrant but made Muted through years of silent, waiting skin. I am absent. They talk of everyday assault that
Turns blue, violet and black in high-color symphony.
Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .
Blues blend to an unforgiving metropolitan black And loneliness seems safer than a gentle night In his arms. I return from the self-defence lessons:
Mistrust is the black-belted, loose white mechanism Of survival against this groping world and I am A convert too. Yet, in the way of all life, he could try
And take root, as I resist, and yield later, like the earth.
Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . . Has he learnt to live my life? Has he learnt never to harm?

Nailed

Men are afraid of any woman who makes poetry and dangerous portents. Unable to predict when, for what, and for whom she will open her mouth, unable to stitch up her lips, they silence her.
Her pet parrot developed an atrocious fetish for the flesh of sacrificial goats, so, Kulamaayi was bolted within a box and dropped in the Kaveri.
She teased and tormented his celibacy, so Miss Success-Village was thrown into a well by a wandering socialite-godman.
She was inaccessible and unattainable, so, Durga was put in an iron trunk that settled on a riverbed and even the men and women who tried to approach her were informed in a prerecorded voice that she was out of reach and network range and coverage area.
She was an outcast who had all the marks of a fiery orator who would some day run for parliament, so, a nail was driven into her head on the instructions of her brahmin fiancé and her coffin was set adrift in a wailing river.
She was black and bloodthirsty, so, even Kali found herself shut inside her shrine.
They were considerably low-risk, so most other women were locked up at home.

Find me a word that has heard of a woman afraid of losing a man she does not have, find me a word that flinches at the thought of being trapped, a word that shows me stealing time, not men. Find me a word that is not so safe. A word for a woman in a forest to wake up with, a woman who knows heat and long silences and sleepless nights, a woman who works with only words.

Once My Silence Held You Spellbound

You wouldn't discuss me because my suffering was not theoretical enough. Enough. Enough. Enough. Now I am theoretical enough. I am theatrical enough.
I have learnt all these big big words. I can use them with abandon. I can misuse them. I can refuse them. I can throw them about and one day, I can throw them out. I am the renegade who can drop these multi-syllable monsters for studied, stylistic effect. I am the rebel who can drop them altogether. I invent new ones every passing day. FYI, OED consults me. Roget's Thesaurus finds it tough to stay updated.

Another Paradise Lost

One sleepy summer afternoon, while helping myself to a glass of chilled water, I saw a snake lying curled under the fridge. It could have been a very poisonous cobra. Very
quickly, I chose my mode of attack: Acid. Staggering, I reached for the glass bottle so that I could pour the yellow-green cheap acid on its slimy body, burning it to death.
""Stop it"", the snake hissed in pure Tamil connecting with me in the language of my prayer and poetry. ""I am an exile."" And I configured mental images of political
refugees. It wriggled out and I saw that it was balding, almost Rushdie-like, perhaps with a death sentence too. Controversy was a crowd pulling catch-phrase, to which I dutifully
succumbed. Acid bottle in hand, I heard the snake preach to me about living in detachment. ""The perfection of life is when you do not know the difference between yielding and
resisting."" The scrawny being writhed further and told me of rebirth and reincarnation. Being a writer I really wanted to take notes. Instead I began arguing. ""Shut up"", the snake said to me,
""Karma and the whole stuff that follows it is just bunkum. You, a crazed agnostic, disagree because of borrowed ideas."" Sharp movements of the red tongue terrified me. Almost sensing my fear, it
said, ""You could never challenge what you do not comprehend."" The snake spoke in circles, in patterns that could only resemble a snake swallowing its tail. Whatever. And then it
occurred to me: Speech was the oldest trap, the charming deceiver, persuasion's weapon and Satan's first area of expertise. ""Stop it"", this time I said the words. ""Tell me just your
story. Save the cant and rant for critical times."" My acidic tone gained me a menacing status and I continued, ""You are a mean serpent. Instigator. Trouble-maker. Sly liar. Undulating
temptation-provider. Unworthy reminder of the seduction of strength over matter."" It protested in a booming resonant voice, ""No, I am not any of this. I am just an exile, from
paradise. Because of your Catholic upbringing, you don't even know about the paradise lost in Hinduism."" Who bothered for history or heritage, except shriveling snakes and failed
writers? At least, we both had something in common. ""Look here comrade, my credentials are different. In heaven, I was an activist. An avid dissenter. Before the accession to heaven,
long long ago, I was a mighty monarch on earth, feared and respected. I was Nahusa the Great. My subjects were happy, the kingdom prosperous. And I ruled for twelve thousand years, until the day
when I decided that I could take leave of life. In heaven too, I was venerated. But one question had plagued me all the years of my long life, and it still tormented me in heaven. I wanted to know why
caste was there, why people suffered because of their karmas. I questioned the Gods, and the learned sages there. I asked them what would happen if an high-born did manual work just like the low-born.
I worried about the division of labor, this disparity
in dreams and destinies. You could say I was a rebel pleading for liberty-equality-fraternity. I had a riotous history of revolution. The Gods plotted against me,
decided that I was trouble. I was cursed to turn into a vile snake. I was banished from paradise. For sixty million years, I shall roam the earth, and then I may return."" This was a different case of the paradise lost.
In this tale, there was no forbidden fruit, no second fickle-minded woman. Tradition triumphed over reason and the good were cast away. I let the serpent go, happy that he had given my hungry mind a story, or
perhaps, a poem to be written on unfair days. I began to respect snakes -- the challengers of hierarchy. While I gave him the freedom of safe passage I vowed never to kill serpents. Much later
I realized brutally that this was just another occupational hazard for choosing a life where I was to be showing solidarity with activists and dissenters.

Prayers

In an arid land of arid human minds Caste, yet again authored a tragedy. He, disease wrecked, downtrodden, long-ago skinner of animals, sets out. Ten days of Typhoid, and a partial recovery. Enough reason to thank some God.
He drags himself clumsily to a nearby temple. Sadly, of an Upper-caste God. Away from the temple, he bends in supplication. Says his last prayer--Unwelcome Gratefulness. To a God who (anyway) didn't help him recover. Innocent Acts of Undulating Faith spurned Anger. Retaliation.
An irked Rajput surged forth and smote the untouchable with a iron rod. He, warrior caste lion couldn't tolerate Encroachment. At the temple. By a Dalit. Deathly howls of a feeble-voiced rent the air, fervently seeking holy intervention. God, Lifeless as ever--watched grimly with closed eyes. In resigned submission, the sick man's Life was given away. Caste--crueler than disease, emotionless, dry, took its toll Confirming traditional truths: Dalits die, due to devotion.
Unanswered questions remain; Agony is not always a forgotten memory.
Life teaches: there are different Gods at different temples. One solitary thought haunts recollection day and night. Where did this poor man's sixty-five year old soul go? To Heaven ­ to join noble martyrs who died for a cause? Or to Hell--where the Gods reside, making Caste Laws.

Returning Home

And the remains of your school where you spent your twelve longest years and lived through everything.
And the bus-stand you had to draw for your art-class in yellow ochre or asphalt grey and the emptiness that now occupies the place where a tiny café once stood.
And the tree where they fed you lunch before you learnt to walk back home. And I thought of my parents.
Brilliant people talking of the intricacies of their life and the corruption of morals and the bygone days and hunger in their childhood and their deaddeardeparted parents as if to teach you what to talk to your children.
(And you are their child, so you speak their lines.) Still returning home,
And there are rusty mammoth girders that outline the sky like the derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes.
And girls so flimsy pretty yet unsafe in the little worlds of lip gloss and love affairs that you could have smoked them into oblivion.
And the dry decaying dead leaves crushed with varying noises and carrying a spent smell that clings to your hair.
And the shy forest noises that violate your fixation over sight and sound and smell and touch yes touch.
And I thought of my lover.
A primitive man who would invade your aloneness on insomniac nights
and challenge your assumptions of love and your sophistications and fill your ears with the four letter words of his ancient language that have begun to sound to you like earth songs to which your body awakens.
(And you are his love, so you listen to his lines.)

Sun In The Mouth

And the truth scorches and singes the pink open flesh of your mouth with its pungent yellow taste, so, speaking the truth is not so easy with just one tongue, anyway.
Seeing might have been closest to truth and as Plotinus said the eye would not be able to see the sun if it was itself not sun and so seeing was understanding.
The Egyptians called the eye with the circle of the iris with the pupil in the centre as the sun in the mouth and that was their truth.
Cyclops must have had little to see in this vast world and deprived of the whole truth and that was his loss, his tragedy.
Even Argus with all his eyes couldn't escape in the end. How much truth, how many eyes of how many senses would it take to tell the truth to the lord of the third-eye?
A king of a Tamil temple city raged mad to know the truth of the scent of a woman's hair. Since money bought truth he made ready, a thousand gold coins.
And a poor poet still married to faith prayed on to Shiva, the lord of struggling survivors, lord of births and lives and deaths, lord of poor poets who gave him
a poem to be sung at the king's court.
A savant there picked a mistake like peeling the scab of a healed wound and said that the poem was wrong. He said that any woman's hair did not have a natural scent.
The lord of dances and grey ash and cremation grounds came down to challenge this stubborn man who extended his truth, even if the woman was the consort of the lord.
He would not budge even if the lord threatened to open his third eye, the eye in the forehead which would reduce him to bone-white ashes as light as the wispiest clouds. The court cowered in fright. . .
But in arrogance the savant said a mistake is a mistake even if it was the lord of the forehead-eye.
O' saint-bard and master of many wily words What do you know of truth or love, or the scent of a woman's hair? On the nights of naked sky and a fragile quarter moon, my lord, he of the deep blue throat, he of the rivers in his hair, he of the third-eye, comes to me. Before he tears the blankness of my womb, before he traces the length of my spine, the curve of my thighs, before he strokes my cheeks, he buries his head in the thousand and one nights of my long tresses and he says it smells like the wind-lost voices
of his childhood summers.

The Belt-Bomb Girl's Suicide Note

The King had sent captains of the army... Their sins and their lawlessness, I'll remember No more. I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, Your transgressions, and like a cloud, your sins.
My strength is made perfect in weakness, There is but a step between me and death. I'll be exalted among the nations, I'll be exalted in the earth.
I'll never leave you nor forsake you. Today, you'll be with me in Paradise. I am the way. Do business till I come. I am the way. Follow me.
Where there is no tale-bearer, strife ceases.
This is the middle way, this is the eightfold path This is the way to the end of suffering.
Right view
Right view is the precursor of the entire path. Right view provides the right practice. Right view leads to a virtuous life. Right view comes at the end of the path. Right view requires you to know that the dying always look up to the sky and therefore you must get ready to shell hospitals.
Right intention
Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, Sickness is suffering, death is suffering, Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are suffering, Association with the unpleasant is suffering, Separation from the pleasant is suffering,
Not to get what one wants is suffering. For the instant cessation of their suffering Right intention requires the carpet bombing Of the fleeing masses.
Right speech
Right speech is about the absence of wrong speech. Abstain from falsehood, abstain from slander, Abstain from harsh speech, abstain from idle chatter. Speech can break lives and start wars, so its best to pull out of the peace talks.
Right action
Right action means refraining from unwholesome deeds that occur with the body as their main means of expression. Do not take life, Do not take what is not given, Do not indulge in sexual misconduct. The celibate Buddha and his monks never spilled any semen and it is our bounden duty to make up for that by raping every woman in sight.
Right livelihood
The Buddha mentions five kinds of livelihood which bring harm to others that must be avoided. The first tells one to avoid dealing in weapons so please get India and China to gift those toys.
Right effort
Right effort requires a wholesome form of energy. Dispelling dullness calls for a special effort to arouse energy through the visualization of a brilliant ball of light or reflection on death. For desire, a remedy of general application is meditation on impermanence to knock away the underlying property of clinging. To get rid of dullness let light into the lives of your enemies through luminous bombs
and to get rid of their desire for one another bulldoze their bunkers and this will be the last time they cling to each other.
Right mindfulness
The first step in right mindfulness involves the contemplation of the body and the last step in the mindfulness of the body involves a series of cemetery meditations which necessitates dreaming of death and decomposition of the human body. Meditate on the mass graves in Chemmani and Mulllivaikkal.
Right concentration
Right concentration implies seclusion from sensual pleasures and reining in the unruly mind. Right concentration is achieved through training so work hard to estimate the exact amount of napalm Or white phosphorous for sky-showers To grant nirvana to the Tamil people, For blessed are they who get to breathe The Laughing Buddha's Laughing Gas.

o the birds have lots and lots and lots to write about o their writings will never be banned
they borrow freedom to write poems in the sky they come back and pass it on to us we take the song only brutally
but at least we take the song
to take the poem to unscramble the words from the song and to put it back again as song so spontaneously that it remains the poem and the song to remember forever this refrain whose melody haunts us and to hum that refrain which preserves our sanity perhaps we need to fly a trifle aimlessly like birds
or because we are humans six-sensed creatures with massive egos and massive superegos and massive egos on the ego and because of possessing gray matter what doctors call medulla oblongata we need to feel with our red hearts than think with some unlocatable mind
we need to look deeper. . . into ourselves, into eyes we need to lose ourselves then, and only then
the poems will come silent wordless as the flight of birds

The Gods Wake Up

Another worst things with the Gods is that They sleep most of the time--
(they don't even dream) . If you happen to go near heaven: It is a very noisy boring place. And all that you get to hear there are-- Thirty three million synchronized godly snores.
(The Goddesses snore too) .
The Gods sleep right through the prayers Performed by the Brahmins--
(maybe they find it boring) . Births, Marriages, innumerable yagnas, Brahmins take the center-stage, all the Gods skip. Also, &quot;Om&quot; is now obsolete-- a kind of recurring mosquito buzz.
(Besides, Om is ©opyrighted) .
At times, the sleeping celestials do stir. Gods always get excited over funerals--
(they are kind of necrophilic) . The loud drums lead the dead to eternal sleep, Ancient noises herald the escaping life. This deeper music shakes the skies. That's when the Gods wake up.
(Just to receive the dead.)

Paracetamol legends I know For rising fevers, as pain-relievers--
Of my people--father's father's mother's Mother, dark lush hair caressing her ankles Sometimes, sweeping earth, deep-honey skin, Amber eyes--not beauty alone they say--she Married a man who murdered thirteen men and one Lonely summer afternoon her rice-white teeth tore Through layers of khaki, and golden white skin to spill The bloodied guts of a British soldier who tried to colonize her. . .
Of my land--uniform blue open skies, Mad-artist palettes of green lands and lily-filled lakes that Mirror all--not peace or tranquil alone, he shudders--some Young woman near my father's home, with a drunken husband Who never changed; she bore his beatings everyday until on one Stormy night, in fury, she killed him by stomping his seedbags. . .
We: their daughters. We: the daughters of their soil.

Babies And The Bathwater

On some days of the week They come up with the lotuses And greet the first rays of the sun In all their fresh/flesh/flush pinkness.
Surfacing, as in a pointillist collage, Speckling the grey-green temple-tank, They float around like fish-food. Bloated, just-born, just-dead babies.
In a tight-lipped, time-tested way, The holy temple removes all traces Of these floundering ones. Chlorinated, The bathwater turns pure once more.

Touch

Have you ever tried meditation? Struggling hard to concentrate, and keeping your mind as blank as a whitewashed wall by closing your eyes, nose, ears; and shutting out every possible thought. Every thing. And, the only failure, that ever came, the only gross betrayal-- was from your own skin.
You will have known this.
Do you still remember, how, the first distractions arose? And you blamed skin as a sinner; how, when your kundalini was rising, shaken, you felt the cold concrete floor skin rubbing against skin, your saffron robes, how, even in a far-off different realm-- your skin anchored you to this earth. Amidst all that pervading emptiness, touch retained its sensuality.
You will have known this.
Or if you thought more variedly, about taste, you would discount it--as the touch of the tongue. Or, you may recollect how a gentle touch, a caress changed your life multifold, and you were never the person you should have been. Feeling with your skin, was perhaps the first of the senses, its reality always remained with you-- You never got rid of it.
You will have known this.
You will have known almost every knowledgeable thing about the charms and the temptations that touch could hold.
But, you will never have known that touch ­ the taboo to your transcendence, when crystallized in caste was a paraphernalia of undeserving hate.

Why Do The Heroes Die?

Unlike in fairy tales, young heroes die. All the dazzling princes, strong men of might, Robinhoods and Messiahs that never lie Are done to death, Evil winning the fight.
Heroes are bled; not just deprived of life God turns in his throne, the dead in cold graves And perhaps death ends the lifetimes of strife. Is slaughter the prize for not being slaves?
Brave men encounter blows, fight their case, Leave forsaking the world they came to mend. `Youth may arise and fill this vacant space' One faint hope; heroes reach the destined end.
Heroes get their Halos. Applause. Praise. All glories shine brighter with sacrifice.

Why She Writes Of Her Love

what came of the margins missing in action? at first the colonel outlawed unrequited love. labelled it defected, subnormal, unfit for men who were men. then at last he crushed the red-hot rebellion of the rainbow border, never letting May mix with December, or, the rich with the poor, or the high with the low. every mismatch was malady.
it was no country for old men or old women. sugar daddies and cougars were banished and the hunchbacked and the handicapped found themselves in this lacklustre blocklove list. the rulebook forbade poets to patronize them. no history--no hyperlinks--no tv--no twitter no news of this love being refused redemption. this love, for twisted souls; this love, the lost cause.

You Don't Know If You Are Yielding Or Resisting

you strive like mad to avoid writing poems about your unseen lover, you concede deep within that you do not know his name or age or what he murders for a living, yet he weaves his way into every poem of yours
you want to write that single poem which is free of him, which does not carry the stains of his masculine scent and which doesn't make you think of his hairless chest and the deftness of his fingers on you and god yes god his eyes you want to write a poem just for yourself, a poem where you do not cringe or stand shame-faced at his worship of himself and how silently and steadfastly he has made you worship him
you have always known that your knowledge of him was very limited--that expecting the stranger to caress you when you cry is an insane idea-- after all when your lover comes he has no memory about the days and months and years he has spent inside your heart and he does not wish to hear for how long you have harboured him right between your breasts
you notice the clock tick away and again you give up writing that poem for it always eludes you
then,you succumb to all your cravings and write all you can about him forgetting the shame and the embarrassment it would cause somehow it seems better than not writing anything at all.

I am an Indian poet in English! How long shall I wear this elegant garland? Can I even put it down?
Poetry in English is like a passion for empire building. It's the subaltern speaking the words pleading to be universally, intently heard.
I guess what I write is no English. Still it's a negotiable alternative to breathing, to the art of living.
It's the aroma to keep my spirits buoyant. It's a reconciliation, a bridge-in-making, between the privileged and the marginalized.
Oh Muses! Teach me how to break down this boundary ­ poets and Indian English poets­erected since ages, between the periphery and the centre.
Make my poetry as delicious as watered-rice-brinjal-fry and dry-fish. To look the world in the eye.
I write in English to free my words lying imprisoned in the arms of the heart. Be it Orissan or Indian, but it's out of this earth and wind.
I am the drunkard and I am the glass of beer. I have committed no sin which you haven't ; I share your fate.
Odia is to think ,feel, dream and be my funeral pyre. English, to me, is my garland and my sword, my sole refuge.
It's the voice of my longings and belongings. honest as the west wind and the yearly floods in coastal Indian villages, it's the frozen marrow in my bones.
But it gives me a name, my very own. It comes to me without tireless waiting. It torrents with the haste of the Yamuna in July rain.
Language is like raindrops shaped into a pearl. It's like happy-healthy sprouted beans ; like red wine from Goa; like silken embroidery on my outfit.
It kick-starts the day with the mercury boiled, it clears all barriers between the heart and the home and hearth.
The alphabets of the English I use, with their jingling anklets, flood my world with joy. Poetry falls down in droplets, the stars melt away.
I am Indian, Odia by birth, with wheatish brown skin, dark eyes. I am just a poet ­ English or no English­ my taverns filled with Muses.

My little son plays around runs like the wind on the sloppy road, the country road, a feast to my eyes; lying on my bed I watch him with flower-like kids flying audible kisses from there at me I hum a tune to myself in my velvety voice keeping a book close to the chest.
The pretty dappled trouts with joyful haste
move in the aquarium like the brook. This was a present to my son on his award of a medal ­ he wants trouts for he loves to see them moving patient, for not being noisey.
I arrange my home with a careless care ­ nightlong in winter, I hear the silence silently here. In full moon nights the nightingales sing frantically in summer. The passionate rain with its vibrations tinkle my inner self, here. I discover a newer world close to nature, close to a power, unknown, and rediscover myself.

At dawn he never sees the skies Which, silently, are born again. Nor feels the shadows of the night Recline their fingers on his eyes. He welcomes neither sun nor rain. His landscape has no depth or height.

Jewish Wedding In Bombay

Her mother shed a tear or two but wasn't really crying. It was the thing to do, so she did it enjoying every moment. The bride laughed when I sympathized, and said don't be silly.
Her brothrs had a shoe of mine and made me pay to get it back. The game delighted all the neighbours' children, who never stopped staring at me, the reluctant bridegroom of the day.
There was no dowry because they knew I was 'modern' and claimed to be modern too. Her father asked me how much jewellery I expected him to give away with his daughter. When I said I did't know, he laughed it off.
There was no brass band outside the synagogue but I remember a chanting procession or two, some rituals, lots of skull-caps, felt hats, decorated shawls and grape juice from a common glass for bride and bridegroom.
I remember the breaking of the glass and the congregation clapping which signified that we were well and truly married according to the Mosaic Law.
Well that's about all. I don't think there was much that struck me as solemn or beautiful. Mostly, we were amused, and so were the others. Who knows how much belief we had?
Even the most orthodox it was said ate beef because it was cheaper, and some even risked their souls by relishing pork. The Sabbath was for betting and swearing and drinking.
Nothing extravagant, mind you, all in a low key and very decently kept in check. My father used to say, these orthodox chaps certainly know how to draw the line in their own crude way. He himself had drifted into the liberal
creed but without much conviction, taking us all with him. My mother was very proud of being 'progressive'.
Anyway as I was saying, there was that clapping and later we went to the photographic studio of Lobo and Fernandes, world-famous specialists in wedding portraits. Still later, we lay on a floor-matress in the kitchen of my wife's family apartment and though it was part midnight she kept saying let's do it darling let's do it darling so we did it.
More than ten years passed before she told me that she remembered being very disappointed. Is that all there is to it? She had wondered. Back from London eighteen months earlier, I was horribly out of practice.
During our first serious marriage quarrel she said Why did you take my virginity from me? I would gladly have returned it, but not one of the books I had read instructed me how.

Minority Poem

In my room, I talk to my invisible guests: they do not argue, but wait
Till I am exhausted, then they slip away with inscrutable faces.
I lack the means to change their amiable ways, although I love their gods.
It's the language really separates, whatever else is shared. On the other hand,
Everyone understands Mother Theresa; her guests die visibly in her arms.
It's not the mythology or the marriage customs that you need to know,
It's the will to pass through the eye of a needle to self-forgetfulness.
The guests depart, dissatisfied; they will never give up their mantras, old or new.
And you, uneasy orphan of their racial memories, merely
Polish up your alien techniques of observation, while the city burns.

Night Of The Scorpion

I remember the night my mother was stung by a scorpion. Ten hours of steady rain had driven him to crawl beneath a sack of rice.
Parting with his poison - flash of diabolic tail in the dark room he risked the rain again.
The peasants came like swarms of flies and buzzed the name of God a hundred times to paralyse the Evil One.
With candles and with lanterns throwing giant scorpion shadows on the mud-baked walls they searched for him: he was not found. They clicked their tongues. With every movement that the scorpion made his poison moved in Mother's blood, they said.
May he sit still, they said May the sins of your previous birth be burned away tonight, they said. May your suffering decrease the misfortunes of your next birth, they said. May the sum of all evil balanced in this unreal world
against the sum of good become diminished by your pain. May the poison purify your flesh
of desire, and your spirit of ambition, they said, and they sat around on the floor with my mother in the centre, the peace of understanding on each face. More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours, more insects, and the endless rain.
My mother twisted through and through, groaning on a mat. My father, sceptic, rationalist, trying every curse and blessing, powder, mixture, herb and hybrid. He even poured a little paraffin upon the bitten toe and put a match to it. I watched the flame feeding on my mother. I watched the holy man perform his rites to tame the poison with an incantation. After twenty hours it lost its sting.
My mother only said Thank God the scorpion picked on me And spared my children.

There is a place to which I often go, Not by planning to, but by a flow Away from all existence, to a cold Lucidity, whose will is uncontrolled. Here, the mills of God are never slow.
The landscape in its geological prime Dissolves to show its quintessential slime. A million stars are blotted out. I think Of each historic passion as a blink That happened to the sad eye of Time.
But residues of meaning still remain, As darkest myths meander through the pain Towards a final formula of light. I, too, reject this clarity of sight. What cannot be explained, do not explain.
The mundane language of the senses sings Its own interpretations. Common things Become, by virtue of their commonness, An argument against their nakedness That dies of cold to find the truth it brings.

Poet, Lover, Birdwatcher

To force the pace and never to be still Is not the way of those who study birds Or women. The best poets wait for words. The hunt is not an exercise of will But patient love relaxing on a hill To note the movement of a timid wing; Until the one who knows that she is loved No longer waits but risks surrendering In this the poet finds his moral proved Who never spoke before his spirit moved.
The slow movement seems, somehow, to say much more. To watch the rarer birds, you have to go Along deserted lanes and where the rivers flow In silence near the source, or by a shore Remote and thorny like the heart's dark floor. And there the women slowly turn around, Not only flesh and bone but myths of light With darkness at the core, and sense is found But poets lost in crooked, restless flight, The deaf can hear, the blind recover sight.

Soap

Some people are not having manners, this I am always observing, For example other day I find I am needing soap For ordinary washing myself purposes. So I'm going to one small shop nearby in my lane and I'm asking for well-known brand soap.
That shopman he's giving me soap but I'm finding it defective version. So I'm saying very politely -- though in Hindi I'm saying it, and my Hindi is not so good as my English, Please to excuse me but this is defective version of well-known brand soap.
That shopman is saying and very rudely he is saying it, What is wrong with soap? Still I am keeping my temper and repeating very smilingly Please to note this defect in soap, and still he is denying the truth.
So I'm getting very angry that time and with loud voice I am saying YOU ARE BLIND OR WHAT? Now he is shouting YOU ARE CALLING ME BLIND OR WHAT? Come outside and I will show you Then I am shouting What you will show me Which I haven't got already? It is vulgar thing to say but I am saying it.
Now small crowd is collecting and shopman is much bigger than me,
and I am not caring so much for small defect in well-known brand soap. So I'm saying Alright OK Alright OK this time I will take but not next time.

The Hill

This normative hill like all others is transparently accessible, out there and in the mind, not to be missed except in peril of one's life.
Do not muse on it from a distance: it's not remote for the view only, it's for the sport of climbing.
What the hill demands is a man with forces flowering as from the crevices of rocks and rough surfaces wild flowers force themselves towards the sun and burn for a moment.
How often must I say to myself what I say to others: trust your nerves-- in conversation or in bed the rhythm comes.
And once you begin hang on for life. What is survival? What is existence? I am not talking about poetry. I am talking about
perishing outrageously and calling it activity. I say: be done with it. I say: you've got to love that hill.
Be wrathful, be impatient that you are not on the hill. Do not forgive yourself or other, though charity is all very well. Do not rest in irony or acceptance. Man should not laugh when he is dying. In decent death you flow into another kind of time which is the hill you always thought you knew.

Ancient Indian Wisdom is 100% correct, I should say even 200% correct, But modern generation is neglecting Too much going for fashion and foreign thing.

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, I am saying (to myself) Lend me the ears. Everything is coming Regeneration, Remuneration, Contraception. Be patiently, brothers and sisters. You want one glass lassi? Very good for digestion. With little salt, lovely drink, Better than wine; Not that I am ever tasting the wine. I'm the total teetotaller, completely total, But I say Wine is for the drunkards only. What you think of prospects of world peace? Pakistan behaving like this, China behaving like that, It is making me really sad, I am telling you. Really, most harassing me. All men are brothers, no?

356,"A Poem For Grandmother

A door. A stair. And two steps inside that dark, the straight-backed chair my grandmother sat in, a lace net draped across its mahogany arm. And on the table, a volume of stories open at the flyleaf, its tissue quill-scarred.
The photographs seal her in a shell of relations: the sepia corset would have her no more than an empress delegating domestic chores; in this room, imagine her gravely accepting tributes of porcelain and sparkling brass or setting tiger lilies afloat in bowls, or stocking pots of pickled mango in the attic of summer.
But the wrong word kills, and empress is wrong, an acrid graft on a delicate stock. Empire was never her creed: grandmother had to learn the principles of governance from practised hands. She had to whet the brusque words of command on waspish crones in the inner courtyard, had to tame the peacocks in the garden and dry the raisins of tact with aunts-in-law, invalids who ruled from brass-bound chests and serene beds of illness.
She grew up with her children, kept house in a city of merchant ships and parade-ground strife, made a home in the rain-gashed heart of that world in whose lanes stowaway Chinese sang the praises of their silk, and coolies peddled cartloads of spices plucked for colder ports. Like the poets of that city, she wrote in two languages, spoke a third in polite company, the lines enjambed over the trellises, the words trapped in porous stone.
She died giving birth to a daughter on Armistice Day, 1931. She grew into the earth, then, a storied fig tree whose roots shot to heaven and branches burrowed
so deep they seeded a forest.
Giving consumed grandmother. Connected to her by nothing more substantial than a spiralled thread of protein, I wake some nights to find her eyes staring at me from the mirror: grandmother when she died, younger than I am now, cut in half by the streetlight's glare.
Hoard your powers, she says, do not give from the core, my son, do not give. Giving spites the flesh, corrodes intention. Most unreliable of barters, most memorable of sins, giving kills. My son, do not, like Karna, rip off the armour that is your skin.

Annotation To The Ustad's Treasury Of Verses

No poems, really, from the Ustad's middle period. Just a few notations he'd left to brew. Her ivory comb. A strand of wool torn free by a trailing fingernail, redder than any gulmohur. Jade bowls standing on a smoke-blackened shelf. In the window, the river's spilt silver. A tortoiseshell cat playing on the doorstep. And, cancelled in a rage of strokes, the grey-eyed sitarist drowning, out of earshot.
Just this broken song, suggesting he had chosen to tarnish his rhymes with a warmer breath than the court would permit. He sings of his draggled woollen coat, his winters spent in a potter's kiln, roofed in colour by fickle skies, the river a shrivelled skin of ice, the wildcat his one companion, the drum and blast of rain his only music: he's begun, already, to hear the perfect cadence beaten on the heart's shattered anvil.

Madman

He dips his pen in a darkened pool that breaks his nib: it's only the shadow of a cloud that's passing above this madman in a soot-black robe.
His long walk is a chase of leaves through a park spelled out in leaf-stripped boughs that offer him no roof, no respite from the flickering snow: he hides his chin in a threadbare scarf, this madman in a soot-black robe.
Or is he the shadow of a cloud that's passing above a darkened pool? He breaks his nib in a chase of leaves, shuffling below the threadbare boughs, testing his will against the snow that flickers in the narrow beam from a window half-opened to the night.
But no door opens to take him in, he stares up at the dying stars. His turn will come, he strops his knife, this madman in a soot-black robe.

Hindsight is a poor cousin to revelation. Listening to the hiss and splatter of rain, the crackle of fire between the words, voicing my breath in strange shapes of mouth
is like looking for you.
The north-rose flowers in every direction on the tattered map I pull from a chest, a hidden magnet around which iron filings frame a crown.
I flatten the continents on a table and read there of our love, not lost but translated, its cadences learned again in other countries by other tongues.

This house has not moved a brick since midnight. Outside the front door, the streetlamp has brushed the cobblestones with a moss of delay: the night glows in a yawn between darkness and day.
The street flows on, soaking the canal with brittle afterimages of rain. The bats that have chased butterflies of meaning up the crescendos of trees all night
are drowsing in their green and icy silhouettes. It is night here still, it will always be night: this street is wound up tight to strike at 3 am and hiss a breath of doubt
into waxy clouds that are talking softly about the ninja maestro who bled the clock dry. They remember the day he parted the curtains and broke the windows with his flame-coloured hands.
They are whispering about the jacarandas that he drowned in the sky beneath the house that has not moved a brick since midnight, and how well cotton burns at noon.

What could I do? I trusted them and they let me down. They'd shamble in, flashing gawky legs, waving bony arms. Or shuffle in crab-wise, bow-legged, too short to sit at table. And there I was, thinking how poised they'd be, how diagram-perfect, walking on air.
Believe me, it gave me no pleasure to tailor them to fit, no pleasure at all. Imagine the horror of breaking ankles, chopping hands at the wrist, stretching ligaments until they snapped, or trepanning a slice of skull. I had to do it all. But it was worth every minute, it was.

Touch unlocks the closed and private cells: unlike the voice, its ends are not gregarious. Searching alone, it brings home what you've lost: open your hands in a shallow fan of ten fingers, and a door clicks open, a child looks through.

The Murder Of The Genie

Deep scar, the ash-white day brands itself on lavender walls. The gulls strike deep in crane territory. A clock ticks in a robot's head, mindful of its destiny.
The fan spins till the breeze begins to slap the blinds. In the squeeze between iris and lid, the window feels the first stir of unrest. Who let the assassin spirit in? Who armed him, who bailed him out?
He must have rehearsed his catgut lines before putting on his ski-mask, turning the doorknob. An inkpot drops in a sailor's head, a letter comes to rest in the cradle.
The mullions framing the gantry ten miles away by skiff are phantoms of mutiny but don't show it. They hold their dignified pose. Nothing connects.
A parrot ransoms the clock for a song. They repeat each other faithfully, translate as two chiming alibis. The curtains shush the piercing needle of the chime; the flash-gun springs from behind a wrinkled tiger mask.
The curtains catch fire even as the grammarian gropes for crucial evidence, signs of a struggle in the thick undergrowth of prescribed tropes
and the flowering false pretences of language.
In the tanglewood, I leave a few odd cinders, the spoor of a maple, the trace of a tune, an eyeful of pale water, my guillotined feet. Draw and quarter fact. Fight clues with clues.
This wisdom shall be proverbial in the room's unforgiving folklore.

You glide in plain view, gravity's nearest slave, floating outside our windows, just out of reach, an ice fruit we'd love to pluck from the sky's jet branches. What stops us is we know the tides would roar and lunge, break their contract if we did: wall-high waves rushing houses and stores, vaulting over gates, an army of madmen dancing on drowned asphalt.
Rain-wrapped, fog-tangled, how easily we forget oceans that have dried and shrunk to ravines where the eye never settles, the heart now never goes. Like the Sea of Tranquillity: so wildly utopian we gave it to you, tattooed it on your skin's acceptance. Safe behind glass and our chartreuse curtains, we watch it float by on full-moon nights and smile.
The mortgage of our nights and days is so quickly claimed. You measure breath in the centuries it takes to carve a pensive ellipse through space. Messages conveyed, you dip below mouldy clouds or submit with reluctance to an eclipse, never more than half deciphered. You keep your dark side hidden as you shine, a riddle orbiting in the wide-open eye.
Sickle of the harvest, lantern of our last rooms! Green moon of January nights, you'll bark at our windows, a dog begging for a bone long after we've gone. Other voices will wake up to answer: survivors from the minefields of sleep, they will pelt you with curses, extradite you to memory.

As in life, he stands tactfully aside for the crowds that jostle to get their seats in the theatre; he knows the plays backwards, it's the audience he's returned to watch, the same carnival that he loved to savour from the safety of the dress circle.
He thinks he's strong enough to withstand the crush, and besides, he's invisible; but the revellers break like a hurricane upon the house, a thousand throats crying in the voices of strange animals driven by fire or flood into the wrong country.

Over my shoulder, I see my country vanish in a long unfurling of cornflower-blue sky. My limbs are clear as glass. The wind grazes my shoulders, the animal buried in my voice wakes up and growls.
Script thrown away, I'm on my own. The detectives will find me when a rainbow prints itself on the litmus sky at noon. I clear my throat, the movie stops.  The hours have stopped in my veins but late-night travellers rush past me, through me, to reach the midnight express. My country's been swallowed by a sky darkening to cloud and sleep. The sixty-four saints have formed a caucus of havoc birds, the rainbow is a stanza they refuse to sing. Close to the tympanum, the horseshoe weather taps cryptic clues. On every clock-face, the hour hand and the minute hand go on mating.  Wakeful, all eye, the havoc birds read the scroll of earth unfolding, every fleck a signal: prey, home, danger,
hiding-place. From a great height, each bird watches its shadow falling to its death.  I vanish, again, in the darkroom. A lamp exposes my heirloom bones. On a park bench, a gardener finds a surplice, drooping, ravelled at the seams: my skin, abandoned in flight. Where I am is a boat without a pilot, sculling through cold water.  Start again.

No footnote explains the hunting songs or the red skein curling downhill in place of the river.

Around, the carousel went around The anxious travelers sought and found Their bags, intact or gently battered, But to my foolish eyes what mattered Was a brave suitcase, red and small, That circled round, not mine at all.
I knew that bag. It must be hers. We hadnt met in seven years! And as the metal plates squealed and clattered My happy memories chimed and chattered. An old man pulled it of the Claim. My bags appeared: I did the same.

Sit, drink your coffee here; your work can wait awhile. You're twenty-six, and still have some life ahead. No need for wit; just talk vacuities, and I'll Reciprocate in kind, or laugh at you instead.
The world is too opaque, distressing and profound. This twenty minutes' rendezvous will make my day: To sit here in the sun, with grackles all around, Staring with beady eyes, and you two feet away.

The Frog And The Nightingale

Once upon a time a frog Croaked away in Bingle Bog Every night from dusk to dawn He croaked awn and awn and awn Other creatures loathed his voice, But, alas, they had no choice, And the crass cacophony Blared out from the sumac tree At whose foot the frog each night Minstrelled on till morning night
Neither stones nor prayers nor sticks. Insults or complaints or bricks Stilled the frogs determination To display his heart's elation. But one night a nightingale In the moonlight cold and pale Perched upon the sumac tree Casting forth her melody Dumbstruck sat the gaping frog And the whole admiring bog Stared towards the sumac, rapt,
And, when she had ended, clapped, Ducks had swum and herons waded To her as she serenaded And a solitary loon Wept, beneath the summer moon. Toads and teals and tiddlers, captured By her voice, cheered on, enraptured: Bravo!  Too divine!  Encore!  So the nightingale once more, Quite unused to such applause, Sang till dawn without a pause.
Next night when the Nightingale Shook her head and twitched her tail, Closed an eye and fluffed a wing And had cleared her throat to sing
She was startled by a croak. Sorry - was that you who spoke?  She enquired when the frog Hopped towards her from the bog. Yes, the frog replied. You see, I'm the frog who owns this tree In this bog I've long been known For my splendid baritone And, of course, I wield my pen For Bog Trumpet now and then
Did you... did you like my song?  Not too bad - but far too long. The technique was fine of course, But it lacked a certain force. Oh!  the nightingale confessed. Greatly flattered and impressed That a critic of such note Had discussed her art and throat: I don't think the song's divine. But - oh, well - at least it's mine.
That's not much to boast about. Said the heartless frog. Without Proper training such as I - And few others can supply. You'll remain a mere beginner. But with me you'll be a winner Dearest frog, the nightingale Breathed: This is a fairy tale And you are Mozart in disguise Come to earth before my eyes.
Well I charge a modest fee. Oh!  But it won't hurt, you'll see Now the nightingale inspired, Flushed with confidence, and fired With both art and adoration, Sang - and was a huge sensation. Animals for miles around Flocked towards the magic sound, And the frog with great precision
Counted heads and charged admission.
Though next morning it was raining, He began her vocal training. But I can't sing in this weather Come my dear - we'll sing together. Just put on your scarf and sash, Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash!  So the frog and nightingale Journeyed up and down the scale For six hours, till she was shivering and her voice was hoarse and quivering.
Though subdued and sleep deprived, In the night her throat revived, And the sumac tree was bowed, With a breathless, titled crowd: Owl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent, Mallard and Milady Trent, Martin Cardinal Mephisto, And the Coot of Monte Cristo, Ladies with tiaras glittering In the interval sat twittering And the frog observed them glitter With a joy both sweet and bitter.
Every day the frog who'd sold her Songs for silver tried to scold her: You must practice even longer Till your voice, like mine grows stronger. In the second song last night You got nervous in mid-flight. And, my dear, lay on more trills: Audiences enjoy such frills. You must make your public happier: Give them something sharper snappier. We must aim for better billings. You still owe me sixty shillings.
Day by day the nightingale Grew more sorrowful and pale. Night on night her tired song
Zipped and trilled and bounced along, Till the birds and beasts grew tired At a voice so uninspired And the ticket office gross Crashed, and she grew more morose For her ears were now addicted To applause quite unrestricted, And to sing into the night All alone gave no delight.
Now the frog puffed up with rage. Brainless bird - you're on the stage Use your wits and follow fashion. Puff your lungs out with your passion. Trembling, terrified to fail, Blind with tears, the nightingale Heard him out in silence, tried, Puffed up, burst a vein, and died.
Said the frog: I tried to teach her, But she was a stupid creature Far too nervous, far too tense. Far too prone to influence. Well, poor bird - she should have known That your song must be your own. That's why I sing with panache: Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash!  And the foghorn of the frog Blared unrivalled through the bog.

The Golden Gate - I (A Novel In Verse)

To make a start more swift and weighty, Hail Muse. Dear Reader, once upon A time, say, circa 1980, There lived a man. His name was John. Successful in his field though only Twenty-six, respected, lonely, One evening as he walked across Golden Gate Park, the ill-judged toss Of a red frisbee almost brained him. He thought, Who'd gloat? Who would be glad? Would anybody?  As it pained him, He turned from this dispiriting theme To ruminations less extreme.
He tuned his thoughts to electronic Circuitry. This soothed his mind. He left irregular (moronic) Sentimentality behind. He thought of or-gates and of and-gates, Of ROMs, of nor-gates, and of nand-gates, Of nanoseconds, megabytes, And bits and nibbles... but as flights Of silhouetted birds move cawing Across the pine-serrated sky, Dragged from his cove, not knowing why, He feels an urgent riptide drawing Him far out, where, caught in the kelp Of loneliness, he cries for help.
John's looks are good. His dress is formal. His voice is low. His mind is sound. His appetite for work's abnormal. A plastic name tag hangs around His collar like a votive necklace. Though well-paid, he is far from reckless, Pays his rent promptly, jogs, does not
Smoke cigarettes, and rarely pot, Eschews both church and heavy drinking, Enjoys his garden, like to read Eclectically from Mann to Bede. (A surrogate, some say, for thinking.) friends claim he's grown aloof and prim. (His boss, though, is well-pleased with him.)
Grey-eyed, blond-haired, aristocratic In height, impatience, views, and face, Discriminating though dogmatic, Tender beneath a carapace Of well-groomed tastes and tasteful grooming, John, though his corporate stock is booming, For all his mohair, serge, and tweed, Senses his life has run to seed. A passionate man, with equal parts of Irritability and charm, Without as such intending harm, His flaring temper singed the hearts of Several woman in the days Before his chaste, ambitious phase.
John notes the late September showers Have tinged the blond hills round the bay With a new green. He notes the flowers In their pre-winter bloom. The way That, when he was a child, the mystery Of San Francisco's restless spark, It strikes him now as, through the park, Wrested from old dunes by the westward Thrust of the greenbelt to the slow Pacific swell, his footsteps go. But it is late. The birds fly nestward Towards the sunset, and the arc Of darkness drifts across the park.
It's Friday night. The unfettered city Resounds with hedonistic glee.
John feels a cold cast of self-pity Envelop him. No family Cushions his solitude, or rather, His mother's dead, his English father, Retired in his native Kent, Rarely responds to letters sent (If rarely) by his transatlantic Offspring. In letters to The Times He rails against the nameless crimes Of the post office. Waxing frantic About delays from coast to coast, He hones his wit and damns the post.
A linkless node, no spouse or sibling, No children - John wanders alone Into an ice cream parlor. Nibbling The edges of a sugar cone By turns, a pair of high school lovers Stand giggling. John, uncharmed, discovers His favorite flavors, Pumpkin Pie And Bubble Gum, decides to buy A double scoop; sits down; but whether His eyes fall on a knot of three Schoolgirls, a clamorous family, Or, munching cheerfully together, A hippie and a Castro clone, It hurts that only he's alone.
He goes home, seeking consolation Among old Beatles and Pink Floyd -- But Girl elicits mere frustration, While Money leaves him more annoyed. Alas, he hungers less for money Than for a fleeting Taste of Honey. Murmuring, Money -- it's a gas! ... The lunatic is on the grass, He pours himself a beer. Desires And reminiscences intrude Upon his unpropitious mood Until he feels that he requires
A one-way Ticket to Ride -- and soon -- Across the Dark Side of the Moon.
He thinks back to his day at college, To Phil, to Berkeley friends, to nights When the pursuit of grades and knowledge Foundered in beery jokes and fights. Eheu fugaces... Silicon Valley Lures to ambition's ulcer alley Young graduates with siren screams Of power and wealth beyond their dreams, Ejects the lax, and drives the driven, Burning their candles at both ends. Thus files take precedence over friends, Labor is lauded, leisure riven. John kneels bareheaded and unshod Before the Chip, a jealous God.

Unclaimed

To make love with a stranger is the best. There is no riddle and there is no test. --
To lie and love, not aching to make sense Of this night in the mesh of reference.

To rest within the unknown arms and know That this is all there is; that this is so.

At Evening

Let me now sleep, let me not think, let me Not ache with inconsistent tenderness. It was untenable delight; we are free-Separate, equal--and if loverless, Love consumes time which is more dear than love, More unreplicable. With everything Thus posited, the choice was clear enough And daylight ratified our reckoning.
Now only movement marks the birds from the pines; Now it's dark; the blinded stars appear; I am alone, you cannot read these lines Who are with me when no one else is here, Who are with me and cannot hear my voice And take my hand and abrogate the choice.

Sunday night in the house. The blinds drawn, the phone dead. The sound of the kettle, the rain. Supper: cheese, celery, bread.
For company, old letters In the same disjointed script. Old love wells up again, All that I thought had slipped
Through the sieve of long absence Is here with me again: The long stone walls, the green Hillsides renewed with rain.
The way you would lick your finger And touch your forehead, the way You hummed a phrase from the flute Sonatas, or turned to say,
""Larches--the only conifers That honestly blend with Wales."" I walk with you again Along these settled trails.
It seems I started this poem So many years ago I cannt follow its ending And must begin anew.
Blame, some bitterness, I recall there were these. Yet what survives is Bach And a few blackberries
Something of the ""falling starlight"", In the phrase of Wang Wei, Falls on my shadowed self. I thank you that today
His words are open to me. How much you have inspired You cannot know. The end Left much to be desired.
""There is a comfort in The strength of love."" I quote Another favourite You vouchsafed me. Please note
The lack of hope or faith: Neither is justified. I have closed out the night. The random rain outside
Rejuvenates the parched Foothills along the Bay. Anaesthetised by years I think of you today
Not with impassionedness So much as half a smile To see the weathered past Still worth my present while.

Smear out the last star. No lights from the islands Or hills. In the great square The prolonged vowel of silence Makes itself plainly heard Round the ghost of a headland Clouds, leaves, shreds of bird Eddy, hindering the wind.

Nobody left to be beautiful. No polyp admiral to sip Blood and whiskey from a skull While fingering his warships. Terrible relics, by tiderace Untouched, the stromalites breathe. Bubbles plop on the surface, Disturbing the balance of death.

Rendezvous

[For Nathan Altermann ] Altermann, sipping wine, reads with a look Of infinite patience and slight suffering. When I approach him, he puts down his book, Waves t the chair beside him like a king, Then claps his hands, and an awed waiter fetches Bread, kosher sausage, cake, a chicken's wing, More wine, some English cigarettes, and matches. `Eat, eat,' Altermann says, `this is good food.' Through the awning over us the sunlight catches His aquiline sad head, till it seems hewed From tombstone marble. I accept some bread. I've lunched already, but would not seem rude. When I refuse more, he feeds me instead, Heaping my plate, clapping for wine, his eyes -Expressionless inside the marble head-- Appearing not to notice how the flies Form a black, sticky icing on the cake. Thinking of my health now, I visualize The Aryan snow floating, flake upon flake, Over the ghetto wall where only fleas Fed well, and they and hunger kept awake Under sharp stars, those waiting for release. Birds had their nests, but Jews nowhere to hide When visited by vans and black police. The shekinah rose where a people died, A pillar of flame by night, of smoke by day. From Europe then the starved and terrified Flew. Now their mourner sits in this café. Telling me how to scan a Hebrew line. Though my attention has moved far away His features stay marble and aquiline. But the eternal gesture of his race Flowing through the hands that offer bred and wine Reveals the deep love sealed in the still face.

[For Yosl Bergner] Tonight I see your blue protuberant eyes Following your angry wife, who sweeps away, With their perpetual look of mild surprise. `Nu, have another drink for luck,' you say I settle back to let your swift talk flow Freer with drink through the small hours till day Reddens the bottles in your studio, While, still unchecked, a rapid spate of words Explains some brush-technique I did not know. A Polish boy, you took cadaverous birds, Perched in a burnt-out Europe, for your text, Then came here, but kept sympathy towards Creatures with wings, for you chose angels next, Though different from those flaming ones that flew Into the Bible: yours are too perplexed Even to fly, waifs without work to do. Yudl reproved you once, in the Cassit: `Your angels are not Israelis, Jew.' No: but they are the images we meet In every mirror: so I understand Those helpless angels waiting in the street For somebody to take them by the hand. Still, hangovers won't await, so now we walk Past herons down the beach towards liquor land. There's not much left to talk of: but you talk, Waving both arms, eccentric, Yiddish, free, In your new home where tall winged creatures stalk Between the ancient mountains and the sea.

The innocent and the guilty, met Here in the garden, feel no fear. But I'm afraid of you, my dear. There was a reason: I forget.
And I by shyness am undone And can't go out for fear I meet My poems dancing down the street Telling your name to everyone.
The lichen peels along the wall. My conversation bores the dove. He knows it all: that I'm in love And you care much and not at all.

Last night - it was a lovely night, And I was very blest Shall it not be for Memory A happy spot to rest?
Yes; there are in the backward past Soft hours to which we turn Hours which, at distance, mildly shine, Shine on, but never burn.
And some of these but yesternight Across my path were thrown, Which made my heart so very light, I think it could have flown.
I had been out to see a friend With whom I others saw: Like minds to like minds ever tend An universal law.
And when we were returning home, 'Come who will walk with me, A little way', I said, and lo! I straight was joined by three:
Three whom I loved - two had high thoughts And were, in age, my peers; And one was young, but oh! endeared As much as youth endears.
The moon stood silent in the sky, And looked upon our earth: The clouds divided, passing by, In homage to her worth.
There was a dance among the leaves Rejoicing at her power, Who robes for them of silver weaves Within one mystic hour.
There was a song among the winds, Hymning her influence That low-breathed minstrelsy which binds The soul to thought intense.
And there was something in the night That with its magic wound us; For we - oh! we not only saw, But felt the moonlight around us.
How vague are all the mysteries Which bind us to our earth; How far they send into the heart Their tones of holy mirth;
How lovely are the phantoms dim Which bless that better sight, That man enjoys when proud he stands In his own spirit's light;
When, like a thing that is not ours. This earthliness goes by, And we behold the spiritualness Of all that cannot die.
'Tis then we understand the voice Which in the night-wind sings, And feel the mystic melody Played on the forest's strings.
The silken language of the stars Becomes the tongue we speak, And then we read the sympathy That pales the young moon's cheek.
The inward eye is open then To glories, which in dreams Visit the sleeper's couch, in robes Woven of the rainbow's beams.
I bless my nature that I am
Allied to all the bliss, Which other worlds we're told afford, But which I find in this.
My heart is bettered when I feel That even this human heart To all around is gently bound, And forms of all a part;
That, cold and lifeless as they seem, The flowers, the stars, the sky Have more than common minds may deem To stir our sympathy.
Oh! in such moments can I crush The grass beneath my feet? Ah no; the grass has then a voice, Its heart - I hear it beat.

'It is that hour when dusky night Comes gathering o're departing light, When hue by hue and ray by ray, Thine eye may watch it waste away, Until thou canst no more behold The faded tints of pallid gold And soft descended the shades of night, As did those hues so purely bright; And in the blue sky, star by star, Shines out, like happiness afar; A wilderness of worlds! - To well In one, with those we have loved well Where bliss indeed! - The waters flow Gurgling, in darkest hue below, And 'gainst the shore the ripple breaks As from its cave, the east wind wakes, But lo! where Dian's crest on high appears, Faint as the memory of departing years.
NIGHT
The moon is gone; and thus go those we love; The night winds wail; and thus for them we mourn; The stars look down; thus spirits from above Hallow the mourners' tears upon the urn. Some thoughts are all of joy, and some of love; Mine end in tears - they're welcome - let them flow .................................... We look around, But vainly look for those who formed a part Of us, as we of them, and whom we wore Like gems in bezels, in the heart's deep core. Where are they now? - gone to that 'narrow cell' Whose gloom no lamp hath broken, nor shall break Whose secrets never spirit come to tell: Oh that their day might dawn, for them they would awake

At The Last Watch

Pity, in place of love, That pettiest of gifts, Is but a sugar-coating over neglect. Any passerby can make a gift of it To a street beggar, Only to forget the moment the first corner is turned. I had not hoped for anything more that day.
You left during the last watch of night. I had hoped you would say goodbye, Just say 'Adieu' before going away, What you had said another day, What I shall never hear again. In their place, just that one word, Bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion Would even that have been too much for you to bear?
When I first awoke from sleep My heart fluttered with fear Lest the time had been over. I rushed out of bed. The distant church clock chimed half past twelve I sat waiting near the door of my room Resting my head against it, Facing the porch through which you would come out.
Even that tiniest of chances Was snatched away by fate from hapless me; I fell asleep Shortly before you left. Perhaps you cast a sidelong glance At my reclining body Like a broken boat left high and dry. Perhaps you walked away with care Lest you wake me up. Awaking with a start I knew at once That my vigil had been wasted I realised, what was to go went away in a moment, What was to stay behind stayed on
For all time.
Silence everywhere Like that of a birds' nest bereft of birds On the bough of a songless tree. With the lifeless light of the waning moon was now blended The pallor of dawn Spreading itself over the greyness of my empty life. I walked towards your bedroom For no reason. Outside the door Burnt a smoky lantern covered with soot, The porch smelt of the smouldering wick. Over the abandoned bed the flaps of the rolled-up mosquito-net Fluttered a little in the breeze. Seen in the sky outside through the window Was the morning star, Witness of all sleepless people Bereft of hope.
Suddenly I found you had left behind by mistake Your gold-mounted ivory walking stick. If there were time, I thought, You might come back from the station to look for it, But not because You had not seen me before going away.

On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.
They build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.
They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.
The sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach.
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships get wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.

Senses

Deliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.
Thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various colours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim.
My world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple.
No, I will never shut the doors of my senses. The delights of sight and hearing and touch will bear thy delight.
Yes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my desires ripen into fruits of love.

She

She who ever had remained in the depth of my being, in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; she who never opened her veils in the morning light, will be my last gift to thee, my God, folded in my final song.
Words have wooed yet failed to win her; persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain.
I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life.
Over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart.
Many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair.
There was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition.

Signet Of Eternity

The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life.
And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.
Thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and the steps that I heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star.

Silent Steps

Have you not heard his silent steps? He comes, comes, ever comes.
Every moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes.
Many a song have I sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes have always proclaimed, `He comes, comes, ever comes.'
In the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes.
In the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes.
In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine.

Sit Smiling

I boasted among men that I had known you. They see your pictures in all works of mine. They come and ask me, `Who is he?' I know not how to answer them. I say, `Indeed, I cannot tell.' They blame me and they go away in scorn. And you sit there smiling.
I put my tales of you into lasting songs. The secret gushes out from my heart. They come and ask me, `Tell me all your meanings.' I know not how to answer them. I say, `Ah, who knows what they mean!' They smile and go away in utter scorn. And you sit there smiling.

Closed Path

I thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power,---that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.

Sleep-Stealer

Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know. Clasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water
from the village near by. It was noon. The children's playtime was over; the ducks in
the pond were silent. The shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the banyan
tree. The crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango
grove. In the meanwhile the Sleep-stealer came and, snatching sleep
from baby's eyes, flew away. When mother came back she found baby travelling the room over
on all fours. Who stole sleep from our baby's eyes? I must know. I must find
her and chain her up. I must look into that dark cave, where, through boulders and
scowling stones, trickles a tiny stream. I must search in the drowsy shade of the bakula grove, where
pigeons coo in their corner, and fairies' anklets tinkle in the stillness of starry nights.
In the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the bamboo forest, where fireflies squander their light, and will ask every creature I meet, ""Can anybody tell me where the Sleep-stealer lives?""
Who stole sleep from baby's eyes? I must know. Shouldn't I give her a good lesson if I could only catch her! I would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen sleep. I would plunder it all, and carry it home. I would bind her two wings securely, set her on the bank of the river, and then let her play at fishing with a reed among the rushes and water-lilies. When the marketing is over in the evening, and the village children sit in their mothers' laps, then the night birds will mockingly din her ears with: ""Whose sleep will you steal now?""

Song Unsung

The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day. I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart. The blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house. The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house. I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.

Still Heart
When I give up the helm I know that the time has come for thee to take it. What there is to do will be instantly done. Vain is this struggle.
Then take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you are placed.
These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying to light them I forget all else again and again.
But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on the floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and take thy seat here.

You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship I worshipped you. In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother you have lived. In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have been nursed for ages. When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered as a fragrance about it. Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow in the sky before the sunrise. Heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you have stranded on my heart. As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all have become mine. For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast.

I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work. When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders, you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the flower, but not know that it cane from me. When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap, I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book, just where you were reading. But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your little child? When in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted lamp in your hand I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.

Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of the day.

In the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you will hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with the lightning through the open window into your room.
If you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the night, I shall sing to you from the stars, ""Sleep, mother, sleep.""
One the straying moonbeams I shall steal over your bed, and lie upon your bosom while you sleep.
I shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your eyelids I shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly I shall flit out into the darkness.
When, on the great festival of puja, the neighbours' children come and play about the house, I shall melt into the music of the flute and throb in your heart all day.
Dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask,""Where is our baby, sister?"" Mother, you will tell her softly, ""He is in the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and in my soul.""

Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines! I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with
these jasmines, these white jasmines. I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth; I have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the
darkness of midnight; Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the
lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover. Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines
that I held in my hands when I was a child. Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with
merrymakers on festival nights. On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song. I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven
by the hand of love. Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh
jasmines that filled my hands when I was a child.

where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee. Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground. They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to
come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand in a corner.
When the rain come they have their holidays. Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white. Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars are. Haven't you see how eager they are to get there? Don't you know why they are in such a hurry? Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms; they have their mother as I have my own.

The Further Bank

I long to go over there to the further bank of the river. Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line; Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with
ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields; Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the
riverside pasture; Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the
jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds. Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman
of the ferry when I am grown up. They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank. Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and
thick reeds grow round the margins where water-birds lay their eggs;
Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny footprints upon the clean soft mud;
Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.
Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.
I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are bathing.
When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon, I shall come running to you, saying, ""Mother, I am hungry.""
When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees, I shall come back in the dust.
I shall never go away from you into the town to work like father.
Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.

The Gardener Iv: Ah Me

Ah me, why did they build my house by the road to the market town?
They moor their laden boats near my trees.
They come and go and wander at their will.
I sit and watch them; my time wears on.
Turn them away I cannot. And thus my days pass by.
Night and day their steps sound by my door.
Vainly I cry, ""I do not know you.""
Some of them are known to my fingers, some to my nostrils, the blood in my veins seems to know them, and some are known to my dreams.
Turn them away I cannot. I call them and say, ""Come to my house whoever chooses. Yes, come.""
In the morning the bell rings in the temple.
They come with their baskets in their hands.
Their feet are rosy red. The early light of dawn is on their faces.
Turn them away I cannot. I call them and I say, ""Come to my garden to gather flowers. Come hither.""
In the mid-day the gong sounds at the palace gate.
I know not why they leave their work and linger near my hedge.
The flowers in their hair are pale and faded; the notes are languid in their flutes.
Turn them away I cannot. I call them and say, ""The shade is cool under my trees. Come, friends.""
At night the crickets chirp in the woods.
Who is it that comes slowly to my door and gently knocks?
I vaguely see the face, not a word is spoken, the stillness of the sky is all around.
Turn away my silent guest I cannot. I look at the face through the dark, and hours of dreams pass by.

Death

O thou the last fulfilment of life, Death, my death, come and whisper to me!
Day after day I have kept watch for thee; for thee have I borne the joys and pangs of life.
All that I am, that I have, that I hope and all my love have ever flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy.
One final glance from thine eyes and my life will be ever thine own.
The flowers have been woven and the garland is ready for the bridegroom.
After the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night.

The Gardener Ix: When I Go Alone At Night

When I go alone at night to my love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind does not stir, the houses on both sides of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud at every step and I am ashamed.
When I sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle on the trees, and the water is still in the river like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly --I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and my eyelids droop, the night darkens, the wind blows out the lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light. I do not know how to hide it.

The Gardener Li: Then Finish The Last Song

The Gardener Lix: O Woman

O woman, you are not merely the handiwork of God, but also of men; these are ever endowing you with beauty from their hearts. Poets are weaving for you a web with threads of golden imagery; painters are giving your form ever new immortality. The sea gives its pearls, the mines their gold, the summer gardens their flowers to deck you, to cover you, to make you more precious. The desire of men's hearts has shed its glory over your youth. You are one half woman and one half dream.

The Gardener Lv: It Was Mid-Day

It was mid-day when you went away .
The sun was strong in the sky. I had done my work and sat alone on my balcony when you went away. Fitful gusts came winnowing through the smells of may distant fields. The doves cooed tireless in the shade, and a bee strayed in my room humming the news of many distant fields. The village slept in the noonday heat. The road lay deserted. In sudden fits the rustling of the leaves rose and died. I gazed at the sky and wove in the blue the letters of a name I had known, while the village slept in the noonday heat. I had forgotten to braid my hair. The languid breeze played with it upon my cheek. The river ran unruffled under the shady bank. The lazy white clouds did not move. I had forgotten to braid my hair. It was mid-day when you went away. The dust of the road was hot and the fields panting. The doves cooed among the dense leaves. I was alone in my balcony when you went away.

The Gardener Lvii: I Plucked Your Flower

I plucked your flower, O world! I pressed it to my heart and the thorn pricked. When the day waned and it darkened, I found that the flower had faded, but the pain remained. More flowers will come to you with perfume and pride, O world! But my time for flower-gathering is over, and through the dark night I have not my rose, only the pain remains.

The Gardener Lxi: Peace, My Heart

Peace, my heart, let the time for the parting be sweet. Let it not be a death but completeness. Let love melt into memory and pain into songs. Let the flight through the sky end in the folding of the wings over the nest. Let the last touch of your hands be gentle like the flower of the night. Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a moment, and say your last words in silence. I bow to you and hold up my lamp to light you on your way.

The Gardener Lxiv: I Spent My Day

I spent my day on the scorching hot dust of the road. Now, in the cool of the evening, I knock at the door of the inn. It is deserted and in ruins. A grim ashath tree spreads its hungry clutching roots through the gaping fissures of the walls. Days have been when wayfarers came here to wash their weary feet. They spread their mats in the courtyard in the dim light of the early moon, and sat and talked of strange lands. They woke refreshed in the morning when birds made them glad, and friendly flowers nodded their heads at them from the wayside. But no lighted lamp awaited me when I came here. The black smudges of smoke left by many a forgotten evening lamp stare, like blind eyes, from the wall. Fireflies flit in the bush near the dried-up pond, and bamboo branches fling their shadows on the grassgrown path. I am the guest of no one at the end of my day. The long night is before me, and I am tired.

I hunt for the golden stag. You may smile, my friends, but I
pursue the vision that eludes me. I run across hills and dales, I wander
through nameless lands, because I am hunting for the golden stag.
You come and buy in the market and go back to your homes laden with goods, but the spell of the homeless winds has touched me I know not when and where.
I have no care in my heart; all my belongings I have left far behind me.
I run across hills and dales, I wander through nameless lands--because I am hunting for the golden stag.

The Gardener Lxviii: None Lives For Ever, Brother

None lives for ever, brother, and nothing lasts for long. Keep that in mind and rejoice.
Our life is not the one old burden, our path is not the one long journey.
One sole poet has not to sing one aged song.
The flower fades and dies; but he who wears the flower has not to mourn for it for ever.
Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.
There must come a full pause to weave perfection into music.
Life droops toward its sunset to be drowned in the golden shadows.
Love must be called from its play to drink sorrow and be borne to the heaven of tears.
Brother, keep that in min and rejoice.
We hasten to gather our flowers lest they are plundered by the passing winds.
It quickens our blood and brightens our eyes to snatch kisses that would vanish if we delayed.
Our life is eager, our desires are keen, for time tolls the bell of parting.
Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.
There is not time for us to clasp a thing and crush it and fling it away to the dust.
The hours trip rapidly away, hiding their dreams in their skirts.
Our life is short; it yields but a few days for love.
Were it for work and drudgery it would be endlessly long.
Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.
Beauty is sweet to us, because she dances to the same fleeting tune with our lives.
Knowledge is precious to us, because we shall never have time to complete it.
All is done and finished in the eternal Heaven.
But earth's flowers of illusion are kept eternally fresh by death.
Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.

The Gardener Lxxix: I Often Wonder

I often wonder where lie hidden the boundaries of recognition between man and the beast whose heart knows no spoken language. Through what primal paradise in a remote morning of creation ran the simple path by which their hearts visited each other. Those marks of their constant tread have not been effaced though their kinship has been long forgotten. Yet suddenly in some wordless music the dim memory wakes up and the beast gazes into the man's face with a tender trust, and the man looks down into its eyes with amused affection. It seems that the two friends meet masked, and vaguely know each other through the disguise.

Defamation

Whey are those tears in your eyes, my child? How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing! You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing-
is that why they call you dirty? O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because
it has smudged its face with ink? For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are
ready to find fault for nothing. You tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
untidy? O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
through its ragged clouds? Take no heed of what they say to you, my child. They make a long list of your misdeeds. Everybody knows how you love sweet things-is that why they
call you greedy? O, fie! What then would they call us who love you?

God whispered, ""I,"" but the ears of the man were stopped.
With a baby asleep at her breast lay his wife, peacefully sleeping on one side of the bed.
The man said, ""Who are ye that have fooled me so long?""
The voice said again, ""They are God,"" but he heard it not.
The baby cried out in its dream, nestling close to its mother.
God commanded, ""Stop, fool, leave not thy home,"" but still he heard not.
God sighed and complained, ""Why does my servant wander to seek me, forsaking me?""

The Gardener Lxxvi: The Fair Was On

The fair was on before the temple. It had rained from the early morning and the day came to its end.
Brighter than all the gladness of the crowd was the bright smile of a girl who bought for a farthing a whistle of palm leaf.
The shrill joy of that whistle floated above all laughter and noise.
An endless throng of people came and jostled together. The road was muddy, the river in flood, the field under water in ceaseless rain.
Greater than all the troubles of the crowd was a little boy's trouble-he had not a farthing to buy a painted stick.
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop made this whole meeting of men so pitiful.

Why do you whisper so faintly in my ears, O Death, my Death?
When the flowers droop in the evening and cattle come back to their stalls, you stealthily come to my side and speak words that I do not understand.
Is this how you must woo and win me with the opiate of drowsy murmur and cold kisses, O Death, my Death?
Will there be no proud ceremony for our wedding?
Will you not tie up with a wreath your tawny coiled locks?
Is there none to carry your banner before you, and will not the night be on fire with your red torch-lights, O Death, my Death?
Come with your conch-shells sounding, come in the sleepless night.
Dress me with a crimson mantle, grasp my hand and take me.
Let your chariot be ready at my door with your horses neighing impatiently.
Raise my veil and look at my face proudly, O Death, my Death!

The Gardener Lxxxiii: She Dwelt On The Hillside

She dwelt on the hillside by edge of a maize-field, near the spring that flows in laughing rills through the solemn shadows of ancient trees. The women came there to fill their jars, and travellers would sit there to rest and talk. She worked and dreamed daily to the tune of the bubbling stream.
One evening the stranger came down from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks were tangled like drowsy snakes. We asked in wonder, ""Who are you?"" He answered not but sat by the garrulous stream and silently gazed at the hut where she dwelt. Our hearts quaked in fear and we came back home when it was night.
Next morning when the women came to fetch water at the spring by the deodar trees, they found the doors open in her hut, but her voice was gone and where was her smiling face? The empty jar lay on the floor and her lamp had burnt itself out in the corner. No one knew where she had fled to before it was morning--and the stranger had gone.
In the month of May the sun grew strong and the snow melted, and we sat by the spring and wept. We wondered in our mind, ""Is there a spring in the land where she has gone and where she can fill her vessel in these hot thirsty days?"" And we asked each other in dismay, ""Is there a land beyond these hills where we live?""
It was a summer night; the breeze
blew from the south; and I sat in her deserted room where the lamp stood still unlit. When suddenly from before my eyes the hills vanished like curtains drawn aside. ""Ah, it is she who comes. How are you, my child? Are you happy? But where can you shelter under this open sky? And, alas! our spring is not here to allay your thirst.""
""Here is the same sky,"" she said, ""only free from the fencing hills,-this is the same stream grown into a river,--the same earth widened into a plain."" ""Everything is here,"" I sighed, ""only we are not."" She smiled sadly and said, ""You are in my heart."" I woke up and heard the babbling of the stream and the rustling of the deodars at night.

Over the green and yellow rice-fields sweep the shadows of the autumn clouds followed by the swift-chasing sun.
The bees forget to sip their honey; drunken with light they foolishly hover and hum.
The ducks in the islands of the river clamour in joy for mere nothing.
Let none go back home, brothers, this morning, let none go to work.
Let us take the blue sky by storm and plunder space as we run.
Laughter floats in the air like foam on the flood.
Brothers, let us squander our morning in futile songs.

Let your work be, bride, the guest had come in the evening.
No, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, do not be frightened.
It is the full moon on a night of April; shadows are pale in the courtyard; the sky overhead is bright.
Draw your veil over your face if you must, carry the lamp to the door if you fear.
No, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, do not be frightened.
Have no word with him if you are shy; stand aside by the door when you meet him.
If he asks you questions, and if you wish to, you can lower you eyes in silence.
Do not let your bracelets jingle when, lamp in hand, you lead him in.
Have no words with him if your are shy.

Have you not lit the lamp in the cowshed?

Flocks of cranes fly up from the further river-bank and fitful gusts of wind rush over the heath.
The anxious cattle run to their stalls in the village.
Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky?
In vain you light your toilet lamp --it flickers and goes out in the wind.
Who can know that your eyelids have not been touched with lampblack? For your eyes are darker than rain-clouds.
In vain you light your toilet lamp-it goes out.

I asked nothing, only stood at the edge of the wood behind the tree.
Languor was still upon the eyes of the dawn, and the dew in the air.
The lazy smell of the damp grass hung in the thin mist above the earth.
Under the banyan tree you were milking the cow with your hands, tender and fresh as butter.
And I was standing still. I did not say a word. It was the bird that sang unseen from the thicket. The mango tree was shedding its flowers upon the village road, and the bees came humming one by one. On the side of the pond the gate of Shiva's temple was opened and the worshipper had begun his chants. With the vessel on your lap you were milking the cow. I stood with my empty can. I did not come near you. The sky woke with the sound of the gong at the temple. The dust was raised in the road from the hoofs of the driven cattle. With the gurgling pitchers at their hips, women came from the river. Your bracelets were jingling, and foam brimming over the jar. The morning wore on and I did not come near you.

I was walking by the road, I do not know why, when the noonday was past and bamboo branches rustled in the wind.
The prone shadows with their outstretched arms clung to the feet of the hurrying light.
The koels were weary of their songs.
I was walking by the road, I do not know why.
The hut by the side of the water is shaded by an overhanging tree.
Some on was busy with her work, and her bangles made music in the corner.
I stood before this hut, I know not why.
The narrow winding road crosses many a mustard field, and many a mango forest.
It passes by the temple of the village and the market at the river landing-place.
I stopped by this hut, I do not know why.
Years ago it was a day of breezy March when the murmur of the spring was languorous, and mango blossoms were dropping on the dust.
The rippling water leapt and licked the brass vessel that stood on the landing-step.
I think of that day of breezy March, I do not know why.
Shadows are deepening and cattle returning to their folds.
The light is grey upon the lonely meadows, and the villagers are waiting
for the ferry at the bank. I slowly return upon my steps, I

You walked by the riverside path with the full pitcher upon your hip.
Why did you swiftly turn your face and peep at me through your fluttering veil?
That gleaming look from the dark came upon me like a breeze that sends a shiver through the rippling water and sweeps away to the shadowy shore.
It came to me like the bird of the evening that hurriedly flies across the lampless room from the one open window to the other, and disappears in the night.
You are hidden as a star behind the hills, and I am a passer-by upon the road.

An unbelieving smile flits on your eyes when I come to you to take my leave.

To tell you the truth I have the same doubt in my mind.
For the spring days come again time after time; the full moon takes leave and comes on another visit, the flowers come again and blush upon their branches year after year, and it is likely that I take my leave only to come to you again.
But keep the illusion awhile; do not send it away with ungentle haste.

in the company of steady wise neighbours. Much knowing has turned my hair
grey, and much watching has made my sight dim.
For years I have gathered and heaped up scraps and fragments of things:
Crush them and dance upon them, and scatter them all to the winds.
For I know 'tis the height of wisdom to be drunken and go the dogs.
Let all crooked scruples vanish, let me hopelessly lose my way.
Let a gust of wild giddiness come and sweep me away from my anchors.

There are men who are easily first, and men who come decently after.
Let them be happy and prosper, and let me be foolishly futile.
For I know 'tis the end of all works to be drunken and go to the dogs.
I swear to surrender this moment all claims to the ranks of the decent.
I let go my pride of learning and
judgment of right and of wrong. I'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering
the last drop of tears. With the foam of the berry-red

For we have made truce with death for once, and only for a few fragrant hours we two have been made immortal.
Even if the king's army came and fiercely fell upon us we should sadly shake our heads and say, Brothers, you are disturbing us. If you must have this noisy game, go and clatter your arms elsewhere. Since only for a few fleeting moments we have been made immortal.
If friendly people came and flocked around us, we should humbly bow to them and say, This extravagant good fortune is an embarrassment to us. Room is scarce in the infinite sky where we dwell. For in the springtime flowers come in crowds, and the busy wings of bees jostle each other. Our little heaven, where dwell only we two immortals, is too absurdly narrow.

Should I neglect all this to gaze after one who has turned her back on me?
That would be rude and foolish, for time is short.
Then, come, my rainy nights with pattering feet; smile, my golden autumn; come, careless April, scattering your kisses abroad.
You come, and you, and you also! My loves, you know we are mortals. Is it wise to break one's heart for the one who takes her heart away? For time is short. It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse and write in rhymes that you are all my world. It is heroic to hug one's sorrow and determine not to be consoled.

This love between you and me is simple as a song.
Your veil of the saffron colour makes my eyes drunk.
The jasmine wreath that you wove me thrills to my heart like praise.
It is a game of giving and withholding, revealing and screening again; some smiles and some little shyness, and some sweet useless struggles.
This love between you and me is simple as a song.
No mystery beyond the present; no striving for the impossible; no shadow behind the charm; no groping in the depth of the dark.
This love between you and me is simple as a song.
We do not stray out of all words into the ever silent; we do not raise our hands to the void for things beyond hope.
It is enough what we give and we get.
We have not crushed the joy to the utmost to wring from it the wine of pain.

The Gardener Xx: Day After Day He Comes

Day after day he comes and goes away.
Go, and give him a flower from my hair, my friend.
If he asks who was it that sent it, I entreat you do not tell him my name-for he only comes and goes away.
He sits on the dust under the tree. Spread there a seat with flowers and leaves, my friend. His eyes are sad, and they bring sadness to my heart. He does not speak what he has in mind; he only comes and goes away.

Dungeon

He whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon. I am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow.
I take pride in this great wall, and I plaster it with dust and sand lest a least hole should be left in this name; and for all the care I take I lose sight of my true being.

The Gardener Xxi: Why Did He Choose

Why did he choose to come to my door, the wandering youth, when the day dawned?
As I come in and out I pass by him every time, and my eyes are caught by his face.
I know not if I should speak to him or keep silent. Why did he choose to come to my door?
The cloudy nights in July are dark; the sky is soft blue in the autumn; the spring days are restless with the south wind.
He weaves his songs with fresh tunes every time.
I turn from my work and my eyes fill with the mist. Why did he choose to come to my door?

The Gardener Xxii: When She Passed By Me

When she passed by me with quick steps, the end of her skirt touched me.
From the unknown island of a heart came a sudden warm breath of spring.

It fell upon my heart like a sigh of her body and whisper of her heart.

Do not keep to yourself the secret of your heart, my friend!
Say it to me, only to me, in secret. You who smile so gently, softly whisper, my heart will hear it, not my ears. The night is deep, the house is silent, the birds' nests are shrouded with sleep. Speak to me through hesitating tears, through faltering smiles, through sweet shame and pain, the secret of your heart!

The Gardener Xxix: Speak To Me My Love

Speak to me, my love! Tell me in words what you sang. The night is dark. The stars are lost in clouds. The wind is sighing through the leaves. I will let loose my hair. My blue cloak will cling round me like night. I will clasp your head to my bosom; and there in the sweet loneliness murmur on your heart. I will shut my eyes and listen. I will not look in your face. When your words are ended, we will sit still and silent. Only the trees will whisper in the dark. The night will pale. The day will dawn. We shall look at each other's eyes and go on our different paths. Speak to me, my love! Tell me in words what you sang.

The Gardener Xxviii: Your Questioning Eyes

Your questioning eyes are sad. They seek to know my meaning as the moon would fathom the sea.
I have bared my life before your eyes from end to end, with nothing hidden or held back. That is why you know me not.
If it were only a gem, I could break it into a hundred pieces and string them into a chain to put on your neck.
If it were only a flower, round and small and sweet, I could pluck it from its stem to set it in your hair.
But it is a heart, my beloved. Where are its shores and its bottom?
You know not the limits of this kingdom, still you are its queen.
If it were only a moment of pleasure it would flower in an easy smile, and you could see it and read it in a moment.
If it were merely a pain it would melt in limpid tears, reflecting its inmost secret without a word.
But it is love, my beloved. Its pleasure and pain are boundless, and endless its wants and wealth. It is as near to you as your life, but you can never wholly know it.

My love, once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his mind.
Alas, I was not careful, and it struck your ringing anklets and came to grief.
It broke up into scraps of songs and lay scattered at your feet.
All my cargo of the stories of old wars was tossed by the laughing waves and soaked in tears and sank.
You must make this loss good to me, my love.
If my claims to immortal fame after death are scattered, make me immortal while I live.
And I will not mourn for my loss nor blame you.

The Gift

I want to give you something, my child, for we are drifting in the stream of the world.
Our lives will be carried apart, and our love forgotten. But I am not so foolish as to hope that I could buy your heart with my gifts. Young is your life, your path long, and you drink the love we bring you at one draught and turn and run away from us. You have your play and your playmates. What harm is there if you have no time or thought for us! We, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days that are past, to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost for ever. The river runs swift with a song, breaking through all barriers. But the mountain stays and remembers, and follows her with his love.

Endless Time

Time is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy minutes.
Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait.
Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.
We have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chance. We are too poor to be late.
And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.
At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; but I find that yet there is time.

The Golden Boat

Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain. I sit on the river bank, sad and alone. The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended, The river is swollen and fierce in its flow. As we cut the paddy it started to rain.
One small paddy-field, no one but me Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere. Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink On a village painted on deep morning grey. On this side a paddy-field, no one but me.
Who is this, steering close to the shore Singing? I feel that she is someone I know. The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead, Waves break helplessly against the boat each side. I watch and feel I have seen her face before.
Oh to what foreign land do you sail? Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while. Go where you want to, give where you care to, But come to the bank a moment, show your smile Take away my golden paddy when you sail.
Take it, take as much as you can load. Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard. My intense labour here by the river I have parted with it all, layer upon layer; Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard.
No room, no room, the boat is too small. Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full. Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro, On the bare river-bank, I remain alone What had has gone: the golden boat took all.

The Hero

Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a strange and dangerous country.
You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a red horse.
It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of Joradighi lies wan and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren.
You are frightened and thinking-""I know not where we have come to.""
I say to you, ""Mother, do not be afraid."" The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs a narrow broken path. There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have gone to their village stalls. It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell where we are going. Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, ""What light is that near the bank?"" Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come running towards us. You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the gods in prayer. The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny bush. I shout to you, ""Don't be afraid, mother. I am here."" With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their heads, they come nearer and nearer. I shout, ""Have a care, you villains! One step more and you are dead men."" They give another terrible yell and rush forward. You clutch my hand and say, ""Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep away from them."" I say, ""Mother, just you watch me."" Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and buckler clash against each other. The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin. Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces. I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your boy must be dead by this time.
But I come to you all stained with blood, and say,""Mother, the fight is over now.""
You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you say to yourself,
""I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort me.""
A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why couldn't such a thing come true by chance?
It would be like a story in a book. My brother would say, ""Is it possible? I always thought he was so delicate!"" Our village people would all say in amazement, ""Was it not lucky that the boy was with his mother?""

The Home

I paced alone on the road across the field while the sunset was hiding its last gold like a miser.
The daylight sank deeper and deeper into the darkness, and the widowed land, whose harvest had been reaped, lay silent.
Suddenly a boy's shrill voice rose into the sky. He traversed the dark unseen, leaving the track of his song across the hush of the evening.
His village home lay there at the end of the waste land, beyond the sugar-cane field, hidden among the shadows of the banana and the slender areca palm, the coconut and the dark green jackfruit trees.
I stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight, and saw spread before me the darkened earth surrounding with her arms countless homes furnished with cradles and beds, mother's hearts and evening lamps, and young lives glad with a gladness that knows nothing of its value for the world.

The Journey

The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed.
We sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.
The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and I laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass.
My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze.
They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries. All honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me.
I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation - -in the shadow of a dim delight.
The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart. I forgot for what I had traveled, and I surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs.
At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes,
I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was hard!

The Judge

Say of him what you please, but I know my child's failings. I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my
little child. How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh
his merits against his faults? When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my
being. When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him. I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may
chastise who loves.

The Kiss

Lips' language to lips' ears. Two drinking each other's heart, it seems. Two roving loves who have left home, pilgrims to the confluence of lips. Two waves rise by the law of love to break and die on two sets of lips. Two wild desires craving each other meet at last at the body's limits. Love's writing a song in dainty letters, layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips. Plucking flowers from two sets of lips perhaps to thread them into a chain later. This sweet union of lips is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles.

The Land Of The Exile
Mother, the light has grown grey in the sky; I do not know what the time is.
There is no fun in my play, so I have come to you. It is Saturday, our holiday.
Leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell me where the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale is.
The shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end. The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails. When the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid in my heart and cling to you. When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves, and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, I like to sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale. Where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of what hills, in the kingdom of what king? There are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath across it by which the villagers reach their village in the evening, or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can bring her load to the market. With patches of yellow grass in the sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their nest, lies the desert of Tepantar. I can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giant's palace across that unknown water. When the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his unhappy mother, abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and wiping her eyes, while he rides through the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale? See, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and thee are no travellers yonder on the village road. The shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their huts, watching the scowling clouds. Mother, I have left all my books on the shelf-do not ask me to do my lessons now. When I grow up and am bid like my father, I shall learn all
that must be learnt. But just for today, tell me, mother, where the desert of
Tepantar in the fairy tale is.

The Last Bargain

""Come and hire me,"" I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stonepaved road.
Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot. He held my hand and said, ""I will hire you with my power."" But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot.
In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors. I wandered along the crooked lane. An old man came out with his bag of gold. He pondered and said, ""I will hire you with my money."" He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.
It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower. The fair maid came out and said, ""I will hire you with a smile."" Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.
The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly. A child sat playing with shells. He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, ""I hire you with nothing."" From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

Mother will say to herself, ""He can give money to whom he likes, for he is grown up."" In the holiday time in October father will come home and, thinking that I am still a baby, will bring for me from the town little shoes and small silken frocks.

On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.
That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.
I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.

There, by the banks of golden streams, fields are full of golden harvest. And in the shade of the forest path the golden champ flower drop on the ground. I will gather them all for you in many hundred baskets. Mother, do you want pearls big as the raindrops of autumn? I shall cross to the pearl island shore. There in the early morning light pearls tremble on the meadow flowers, pearls drop on the grass, and pearls are scattered on the sand in spray by the wild sea-waves. My brother shall have a pair of horses with wings to fly among the clouds. For father I shall bring a magic pen that, without his knowing, will write of itself. For you, mother, I must have the casket and jewel that cost seven kings their kingdom.

Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the forest.
O child, do not go out! The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river is haunted by a deepening gloom. Our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence. O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall. Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who has run away from his mother to tease her. Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford. O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry is closed. The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers. The evening lamps must be made ready. O child, do not go out! The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.

She went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was young.
Now the flowers are in high bloom and I call, ""Come back, my darling. The children gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport. And if you come and take one little blossom no one will miss it.""
Those that used to play are playing still, so spendthrift is life.

There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing. Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each other.

When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me then, mother? You never say a word when father writes. When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all. But if I take only one sheet to take a boat with, you say, ""Child, how troublesome you are!"" What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over both sides?

Fairyland

If people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish into the air.
The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold. The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms. But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is. It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands. The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas. There is none in the world who can find her but myself. She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor. She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles. But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands. When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof. I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together. Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the barber in the story lives. But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives. It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.

Threshold

I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life.
What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight!
When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother.
Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well.
The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away, in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation.

Twelve O'Clock

Mother, I do want to leave off my lessons now. I have been at my book all the morning.
You say it is only twelve o'clock. Suppose it isn't any later; can't you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve o'clock?
I can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of that rice-field, and the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for her supper by the side of the pond.
I can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing darker under the madar tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny black.
If twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night come when it is twelve o'clock?

Unending Love

I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times... In life after life, in age after age, forever. My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs, That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms, In life after life, in age after age, forever.
Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, it's age-old pain, It's ancient tale of being apart or together. As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge, Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time: You become an image of what is remembered forever.
You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount. At the heart of time, love of one for another. We have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewellOld love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.
Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you The love of all man's days both past and forever: Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life. The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours ­ And the songs of every poet past and forever.

Ungrateful Sorrow

At dawn shey departed My mind tried to console me ' Everything is Maya'. Angrily I replied: 'Here's this sewing box on the table, that flower-pot on the terrace, this monogrammed hand-fan on the bed- all these are real.'
My mind said: 'Yet, think again.' I rejoined: ' You better stop. Look at this storybook, the hairpin halfway amongst its leaves, signaling the rest is unread; if all these things are 'Maya', then why should 'shey' be more unreal? '
My mind becomes silent. A friend arrived and says: 'That which is good is real it is never non-existent; entire world preserves and cherishes it its chest like a precious jewel in a necklace.'
I replied in anger: 'How do you know? Is a body not good? Where did that body go? '
Like a small boy in a rage hitting his mother, I began to strike at everything in this world that gave me shelter. And I screamed:' The world is treacherous.'
Suddenly, I was startled. It seemed like someone admonished me:' You- ungrateful! '
I looked at the crescent moon hidden behind the tamarisk tree outside my window. As if the dear departed one is smiling and playing hide-and-seek with me.
From the depth of darkness punctuated by scattered stars came a rebuke: 'when I let you grasp me you call it an deception, and yet when I remain concealed, why do you hold on to your faith in me with such conviction? '

Untimely Leave

No more noisy, loud words from me---such is my master's will. Henceforth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.
Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.
Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.
Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!

Unyielding

When I called you in your garden Mango blooms were rich in fragrance Why did you remain so distant, Keep your doors so tightly fastened? Blossoms grew to ripe fruit-clusters Your rejected my cuppded handfuls, Closed your eyes to perfectness.
In the fierce harsh storms of Baisakh, Golden ripened fruit fell tumbling. 'Dust, I said, 'defiles such offerings: Let your hands be heaven to them.' Still you showed no friendliness.
Lampless were your doors at evening, Pitch-black as I played my vina. How the starlight twanged my heartstrings! How I set my vina dancing! You showed no responsiveness.
Sad birds twittered sleeplessly, Calling, calling lost companions. Gone the right time for our union Low the moon while still you brooded, Sunk in lonely pensiveness.
Who can understand another! Heart cannot restrain its passion. I had hoped that some remaining Tear-soaked memories would sway you, Stir your feet to lightsomeness.
Moon fell at the feet of morning, Loosened from the night's fading necklace. While you slept, O did my Vina Lull you with its heartache? Did you Dream at least of happiness?

Vocation

When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our lane.
Every day I meet the hawker crying, ""Bangles, crystal bangles!""
There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home.
I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying, ""Bangles, crystal bangles!""
When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school, I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging the ground. He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or gets wet. I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with nobody to stop me from digging. Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to bed, I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and down. The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like a giant with one red eye in its head. The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at his side, and never once goes to bed in his life. I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night, chasing the shadows with my lantern.

Waiting

The song I came to sing remains unsung to this day. I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.
The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart.....
I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.....
But the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house; I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.

We Are To Play The Game Of Death

WE are to play the game of death to-night, my bride and I. The night is black, the clouds in the sky are capricious, and the waves are raving at sea. We have left our bed of dreams, flung open the door and come out, my bride and I. We sit upon a swing, and the storm winds give us a wild push from behind. My bride starts up with fear and delight, she trembles and clings to my breast. Long have I served her tenderly. I made for her a bed of flowers and I closed the doors to shut out the rude light from her eyes. I kissed her gently on her lips and whispered softly in her ears till she half swooned in languor. She was lost in the endless mist of vague sweetness. She answered not to my touch, my songs failed to arouse her. To-night has come to us the call of the storm from the wild. My bride has shivered and stood up, she has clasped my hand and come out. Her hair is flying in the wind, her veil is fluttering, her garland rustles over her breast. The push of death has swung her into life. We are face to face and heart to heart, my bride and I.

When I sing to make you dance, I truly know why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth-when I sing to make you dance.
When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands, I know why there is honey in the cup of the flower, and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice-when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands.
When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and what delight the summer breeze brings to my body-when I kiss you to make you smile.

When I sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle on the trees, and the water is still in the river like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep. It is my own heart that beats wildly -- I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and my eyelids droop, the night darkens, the wind blows out the lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars. It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light. I do not know how to hide it.

Fireflies

My fancies are fireflies, -- Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.
The voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.
In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.
Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.
Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.
My words that are slight may lightly dance upon time's waves when my works heavy with import have gone down.
Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.
The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.

Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.
From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.
My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.
In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.
The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.
Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.
Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.
Bigotry tries to keep truth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.

The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.
Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.
Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, -- a phantasy in time's dream.
While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.

Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.
My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over.
I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitful, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.
The one without second is emptiness,
the other one makes it true.
Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.
They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.

Dawn--the many-coloured flower--fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.

The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, 'Alas.' Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.
The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.
The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.
He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.
Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.
With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.
The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.
Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.
The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.
The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.
We gain freedom when we have paid the full price for our right to live.
Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.
The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.
Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs out to him before her time and meets her doom.
The world is the ever-changing foam that floats on the surface of a sea of silence.
The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.
As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.
I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost its blossom, but the azalea brings to me, my love, thy forgiveness.
Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.
The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.
Birth is from the mystery of night into the greater mystery of day.
These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.
Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.
The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.
Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.
You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.
The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.
God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.
The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.
The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message
of the immemorial seed.
Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.
My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.
The fire of pain traces for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.

I know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence.

Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.

Baby's Way

If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment. It is not for nothing that he does not leave us. He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever
bear to lose sight of her. Baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can
understand their meaning. It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak. The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from
mother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent. Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar
on to this earth. It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise. This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly
helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love. Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny
crescent moon. It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom. He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little
corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught and pressed in her dear arms.
Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect bliss.
It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears. Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles weave the double bond of pity and love.

Music is silenced, the dark descending slowly Has stripped unending skies of all companions. Weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons Dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears. Still, O bird, O sightless bird, Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.
It's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls Of an ocean's drowsy booming, Not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam. Where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves? Where the nest and the branch's hold? Still, O bird, my sightless bird, Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.
Stretching in front of you the night's immensity Hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun; Still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming Across the shoreless dark a crescent moon Has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon. -But O my bird, O sightless bird, Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.
From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers Intently watch your course and death's impatience Lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves; And sad entreaties line the farthest shore With hands outstretched and crooning 'Come, O come!' Still, O bird, O sightless bird, Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.
All that is past: your fears and loves and hopes; All that is lost: your words and lamentation; No longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers. For wings are all you have, and the sky's broadening countryard, And the dawn steeped in darkness, lacking all direction.
Dear bird, my sightless bird, Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings!

I wonder if I know him In whose speech is my voice, In whose movement is my being, Whose skill is in my lines, Whose melody is in my songs In joy and sorrow. I thought he was chained within me, Contained by tears and laughter, Work and play. I thought he was my very self Coming to an end with my death. Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him In the sight and touch of my beloved? This 'I' beyond self I found On the shores of the shining sea. Therefore I know This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds. Losing myself, I find him Beyond the borders of time and space. Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths. The Supreme undivided, complete in himself, Embracing past and present, Dwells in Man. Within Him I shall find myself The 'I' that reaches everywhere.

I Am Restless

I am restless. I am athirst for far-away things. My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance. O Great Beyond, O the keen call of thy flute! I forget, I ever forget, that I have no wings to fly, that I am bound in this spot evermore.
I am eager and wakeful, I am a stranger in a strange land. Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope. Thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own. O Far-to-seek, O the keen call of thy flute! I forget, I ever forget, that I know not the way, that I have not the winged horse.
I am listless, I am a wanderer in my heart. In the sunny haze of the languid hours, what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky! O Farthest end, O the keen call of thy flute! I forget, I ever forget, that the gates are shut everywhere in the house where I dwell alone!

I Cast My Net Into The Sea

In the morning I cast my net into the sea.
I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty -some shone like a smile, some glistened like tears, and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride.
When with the day's burden I went home, my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower.
I hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up, and stood silent.
She glanced at them and said, 'What strange things are these? I know not of what use they are!'
I bowed my head in shame and thought, 'I have not fought for these, I did not buy them in the market; they are not fit gifts for her.'
Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the street.
In the morning travellers came; they picked them up and carried them into far countries.

I Found A Few Old Letters

I found a few old letters of mine carefully hidden in thy box--a few small toys for thy memory to play with. With a timorous heart thou didst try to steal these trifles from the turbulent stream of time which washes away planets and stars, and didst say, ""These are only mine!"" Alas, there is no one now who can claim them--who is able to pay their price; yet they are still here. Is there no love in this world to rescue thee from utter loss, even like this love of thine that saved these letters with such fond care? O woman, thou camest for a moment to my side and touched me with the great mystery of the woman that there is in the heart of creation--she who ever gives back to God his own outflow of sweetness; who is the eternal love and beauty and youth; who dances in bubbling streams and sings in the morning light; who with heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth and whose mercy melts in rain; in whom the eternal one breaks in two in joy that can contain itself no more and overflows in the pain of love.

In The Dusky Path Of A Dream

IN the dusky path of a dream I went to seek the love who was mine in a former life.
Her house stood at the end of a desolate street. In the evening breeze her pet peacock sat drowsing on its perch, and the pigeons were silent in their corner.
She set her lamp down by the portal and stood before me. She raised her large eyes to my face and mutely asked, 'Are you well, my friend?' I tried to answer, but our language had been lost and forgotten.
I thought and thought; our names would not come to my mind. Tears shone in her eyes. She held up her right hand to me. I took it and stood silent.
Our lamp had flickered in the evening breeze and died.

It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.
The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end.
My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said `Here art thou!'
The question and the cry `Oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance `I am!'

I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind, and out beyond all bounds;

Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, the Truth sets Fact free from its fetters.

Dark? However dark she be, I have seen her dark gazelleeyes.
Two black cows were lowing, as it grew dark under the heavy clouds. So with anxious, hurried steps, the dark girl came from her hut. Raising her eyebrows toward the sky, she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.
Dark? However dark she be, I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
A gust of the east wind rippled the rice plants. I was standing by a ridge, alone in the field. Whether or not she looked at me Is known only to us two.
Dark? However dark she be, I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
This how the Kohldark cloud rises in the northeast in Jaistha; the soft dark shadow descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh; and sudden delight floods the heart in the night of Sravan.
Dark? However dark she be, I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.
To me she is the flower Krishnakali, whatever she may be called by others. In a field in Maynapara village I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes. She did not cover her head, not having the time to feel embarrassed.

Misery knocks at thy door, and her message is that thy lord is wakeful, and he calls thee to the love-tryst through the darkness of night.
The sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless. I know not what this is that stirs in me--I know not its meaning.
A moment's flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight, and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me.

When I think of this end of my moments, the barrier of the moments breaks and I see by the light of death thy world with its careless treasures. Rare is its lowliest seat, rare is its meanest of lives.

For I give to thee my cup filled with all the pain and delight that the crushed grapes of my heart had surrendered, I wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed, And with the molten gold of my desires I fashioned playthings for thy passing hours. I know not why thou chosest me for thy partner, Lord of my life.
Didst thou store my days and nights, my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art, and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring, and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?
I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart, Lord of my life, I wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven. For many were my days without service and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers that faded in the shade not offered to thee.
Often the tied strings of my lute slackened at the strains of thy tunes. And often at the ruin of wasted hours my desolate evenings were filled with tears.
But have my days come to their end at last, Lord of my life, while my arms round thee grow limp, my kisses losing their truth? Then break up the meeting of this languid day! Renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight; and let the wedding come once again in a new ceremony of life.

The Summer will come in its time, sailing in the flood-tide of the south wind. But you never counted slow moments to be sure of him. You recklessly spent your all in the road, in the terrible joy of faith.

Beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous shadows, and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to take flight across the desert of dimness, in the passionate thirst for forms. They are lampless pilgrims, seeking the shore of light, to find themselves in things.

Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of sunbeam. We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine anger.
Like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning stars. He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest. Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. THe women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. Quickly came I to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, I said, ""Lord, accept my service.""
I led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, I dried his feet with my trailing hair. When I raised my face and looked into his eyes, I thought I felt the world's first kiss to the first woman, -Blessed am I, blessed is God, who made me a woman. I heard him say to me, ""What God unknown are you? YOur touch is the touch of the Immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight.""
Ah, no, not that smile, King's Councillor, -the dust of worldly wisdom has covered your sight, old man. But this boy's innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman divine....
The women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose they began to pelt him with flowers.
Alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to cover you in its folds? I fell at his feet and cried, ""Forgive me. "" I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as I fled, "" Forgive me. "" The women's foul laughter pressed me like a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" What God

No, it cannot be. Had the life-flood utterly stopped in you, it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in her cadence of colours. Had the glimmering dusk of your hair vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would die with its dreams.
Can it be true that I forgot you? We haste on without heed, forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. Yet they breathe unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. You have moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.

Her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their winter quilts. The water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day after day, on the footpath leading to the village.

Of a sudden sea of joy surges through his heart ­ The ur-god opens his eyes. Speech from four mouths Speeds from each quarter. Through infinite dark, Through limitless sky, Like a growing sea-storm, Like hope never sated, His Word starts to move.
Stirred by joy his breathing quickens, His eight eyes quiver with flame. His fire-matted hair sweeps the horizon, Bright as a million suns.
From the towering source of the world In a thousand streams Cascades the primeval blazing fountain, Fragmenting silence,
Splitting its stone heart.

II THE MUSIC
In a universe rampant With new life exhalant, With new life exultant, Vishnu spreads wide His four-handed blessing. He raises his conch And all things quake At its booming sound. The frenzy dies down, The furnace expires, The planets douse Their flames with tears, The world's Divine Poet Constructs its history, From wild cosmic song Its epic is formed. Stars in their orbits, Moon sun and planets ­ He binds with his mace All things to Law, Imposes the discipline Of metre and rhyme.
In the Manasa depths Vishnu watches Beauties arise From the light of lotuses. Lakshmi strews smiles Clouds show a rainbow, Gardens show flowers. The roar of Creation Resolves into music. Softness hides rigour,
Forms cover power.
tirascino vitato rasmir esam: adhah svid asid, upari svid asit? retodha asan, mahimana asan; svadha avasat, prayatih parastat.
Age after age after age is slave to a mighty rhythm ­ At last the world-frame Tires in its body, Sleep in its eyes Slackens its structure, Diffuses its energy. From the heart of all matter Comes the anguished cry ­ `Wake, wake, great Shiva, Our body grows weary Of its law-fixed path, Give us new form. Sing our destruction, That we gain new life.'
III THE FIRE
The great god awakes, His three eyes open, He surveys all horizons. He lifts his bow, his fell pinaka, He pounds the world with his tread. From first things to last it trembles and shakes And shudders. The bonds of nature are ripped. The sky is rocked by the roar Of a wave of ecstatic release. An inferno soars ­ The pyre of the universe.
Shattered sun and moon, smashed stars and planets, Rain down from all angles, A blackness of all particles To be swallowed by flame, Absorbed in an instant.
At the start of Creation There was a dark without origin, At the breaking of Creation There is fire without end In an all-pervading sky-engulfing sea of burning Shiva shuts his three eyes. He begins his great trance.
ko adha veda? Ka iha pravocat, kuta ajata, kuta iyam visrstih? arvag deva asya visajanena: atha ko veda yata ababhuva?
iyam visrstir yata ababhuva; yadi vasa dadhe yadi van na: yo asyadhyaksah parame vioman so anga veda, yadi va na veda.

Lover's Gifts : Your Days

Your days will be full of cares, if you must give me your heart. My house by the cross-roads has its doors open and my mind is absent, -for I sing.
I shall never be made to answer for it, if you must give me your heart. If I pledge my word to you in tunes now, and am too much in earnest to keep it when music is silent, you must forgive me; for the law laid down in May is best broken in December.
Do not always keep remembering it, if you must give me your heart. When your eyes sing with love, and your voice ripples with laughter, my answers to your questions will be wild, and not miserly accurate in facts, -they are to be believed for ever and then forgotten for good.

Lover's Gifts : I Shall Gladly Suffer

I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house, if only in some happy future I am born a herd-boy in the Brinda forest.
The herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to splash and plunge in the Jamuna's cool deep stream.
He calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the courtyard to milk the king.
As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds.
When the April night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks of the blue river.
No, I will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of new Bengal; I shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for the benighted. If only I could be born, under the shady asoka groves, in some village of Brinda, where milk is churned by the maidens!

Therefore his sky seems to ache with the pain of countless meetings and partings, and a longing pervades this spring breeze, -the longing that is full of the whisper of ages without beginning.

Maran-Milan (Death-Wedding)

Why do you speak so softly, Death, Death, Creep upon me, watch me so stealthily? This is not how a lover should behave. When evening flowers droop upon their tired Stems, when cattle are brought in from the fields After a whole day's grazing, you, Death, Death, approach me with such gentle steps, Settle yourself immovably by my side. I cannot understand the things you say.
Alas, will this be how you will take me, Death, Death? Like a thief, laying heavy sleep On my eyes as you descend to my heart? Will you thus let your tread be a slow beat In my sleep-numbed blood, your jingling ankle-bells A drowsy rumble in my ear? Will you, Death, Death, wrap me, finally, in your cold Arms and carry me away while I dream? I do not know why you thus come and go.
Tell me, is this the way you wed, Death, Death? Unceremonially, with no Weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer? Will you come with your massy tawny hair Unkempt, unbound into a bright coil-crown? Will no one bear your victory-flag before Or after, will no torches glow like red Eyes along the river, Death, Death? Will earth not quake in terror at your step?
When fierce-eyed Siva came to take his bride, Remember all the pomp and trappings, Death, Death: the flapping tiger-skins he wore; His roaring bull; the serpents hissing round His hair; the bom-bom sound as he slapped his cheeks; The necklace of skulls swinging round his neck; The sudden raucous music as he blew His horn to announce his coming - was this not A better way of wedding, Death, Death?
And as that deathly wedding-party's din Grew nearer, Death, Death, tears of joy Filled Gauri's eyes and the garments at her breast Quivered; her left eye fluttered and her heart Pounded; her body quailed with thrilled delight And her mind ran away with itself, Death, Death; Her mother wailed and smote her head at the thought Of receiving so wild a groom; and in his mind Her father agreed calamity had struck.
Why must you always come like a thief, Death, Death, always silently, at night's end, Leaving only tears? Come to me festively, Make the whole night ring with your triumph, blow Your victory-conch, dress me in blood-red robes, Grasp me by the hand and sweep me away! Pay no heed to what others may think, Death, Death, for I shall of my own free will Resort to you if you but take me gloriously.
If I am immersed in work in my room When you arrive, Death, Death, then break My work, thrust my unreadiness aside. If I am sleeping, sinking all desires In the dreamy pleasure of my bed, or I lie With apathy gripping my heart and my eyes Flickering between sleep and waking, fill Your conch with your destructive breath and blow, Death, Death, and I shall run to you.
I shall go to where your boat is moored, Death, Death, to the sea where the wind rolls Darkness towards me from infinity. I may see black clouds massing in the far North-east corner of the sky; fiery snakes Of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised, But I shall not flinch in unfounded fear I shall pass silently, unswervingly Across that red storm-sea, Death, Death.

Thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. This thy self-separation has taken body in me.
The poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloued tears and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, dreams break and form. In me is thy own defeat of self.
This screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures with the brush of the night and the day. Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, casting away all barren lines of straightness.

The night is black and the forest has no end; a million people thread it in a million ways. We have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where or with whom - of that we are unaware. But we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips. Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks. Then peradventure there's a flash of lightning: whomever I see that instant I fall in love with. I call that person and cry: `This life is blest! for your sake such miles have I traversed!' All those others who came close and moved off in the darkness - I don't know if they exist or not.

withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.
They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.
The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach.
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.

One Day In Spring....

One day in spring, a woman came In my lonely woods, In the lovely form of the Beloved. Came, to give to my songs, melodies, To give to my dreams, sweetness. Suddenly a wild wave Broke over my heart's shores And drowned all language. To my lips no name came, She stood beneath the tree, turned, Glanced at my face, made sad with pain, And with quick steps, came and sat by me. Taking my hands in hers, she said: 'You do not know me, nor I youI wonder how this could be?' I said: 'We two shall build, a bridge for ever Between two beings, each to the other unknown, This eager wonder is at the heart of things.'
The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart; The thread with which she binds me binds her too. Her have I sought everywhere, Her have I worshipped within me, Hidden in that worship she has sought me too. Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart. She forgot to return, having lost her own. Her own charms play traitor to her, She spreads her net, knowing not Whether she will catch or be caught.

As the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is ---`I want thee, only thee'.

Palm Tree

Palm-tree: single-legged giant, topping other trees, peering at the firmament It longs to pierce the black cloud-ceiling and fly away, away, if only it had wings.
The tree seems to express its wish in the tossing of its head: its fronds heave and swish It thinks, Maybe my leaves are feathers, and nothing stops me now from rising on their flutter.
All day the fronds the windblown tree soar and flap and shudder as though it thinks it can fly, As though it wanders in the skies, travelling who knows where, wheeling past the stars -
And then as soon as the wind dies down, the fronds subside, subside: the mind of the tree returns. To earth, recalls that earth is its mother: and then it likes once more its earthly corner.

I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race with my boats!

The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins their baskets full of dreams.

Broken Song

Kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound: The seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds. His voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere, It darts like lightening - no knowing where it will go when. He sets deadly traps for himself, then cuts them away: The courtiers listen in amazement, give frequent gasps of praise. Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood, unmoved. Haraj Lal is the only singer he likes, all others leave him cold. From childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing Rag Kafi during holi, cloud-songs during the rains, Songs for Durga at dawn in autumn, songs to bid her farewell His heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears. And on days when friends gathered and filled the hall There were cowherds' songs of Krsna, in raags Bhupali and Multan.
So many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house: Servants dressed in red, hundreds of lamps alight: The bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels, Young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear: Before him, singing raag Sahana, sits Baraj Lal. The king's heart is full of all those days and songs. When he hears some other singer, he feels no chord inside, No sudden magical awakening of memories of the past. When Pratap Ray watches Kasinath he just sees his wagging head: Tune after tune after tune, bu none with any echo in the heart.
Kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space. Pratap Ray smilingly turns his eyes to Baraj Lal. He puts his mouth to his ear and says, 'Dear ustad, Give us a song as songs ought to be, this is no song at all. It's all tricks and games, like a cat hunting a bird. We used to hear songs in the old days, today they have no idea.'
Old Baraj Lal, white-haired, white turban on his head, Bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat. He takes the tanpura in his wasted, heavily veined hand And with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag Yaman-kalyap. His quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall, Is like a tiny bird in a storm, unable to fly for all it tries.
Pratap Ray, sitting to the left, encourages him again and again: 'Superb, bravo!' he says in his ear, 'sing out loud.'
The courtiers are inattentive, some whisper amongst themselves, Some of them yawn, some doze, some go off to their rooms; Some of them call to servants, 'Bring the bookah, bring some pan.' Some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat. They cannot keep still for a minute, they shuffle or walk about The hall was quiet before, but every sort of noise has grown. The old man's singing is swamped, like a frail boat in a typhoon: Only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there.
Music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart Is crushed by heedless clamour, like a fountain under a stone. The song and Baraj Lal's feelings go separate ways, But he sings for all he is worth, to keep up the honour of his king.
One of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind. He quickly goes back, tries to get it right this time. Again he forgets, it is lost, he shakes his head at the shame; He starts the song at the beginning - again he has to stop. His hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name. His voice quakes with distress, like a lamp guttering in a breeze. He abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune, But suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries. The intricate melody goes to the winds, the rhythm is swept away Tears snap the thread of the song, cascade like pearls. In shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap He has failed to remember a song: he weeps as he did as a child. With brimming eyes king Pratap Ray tenderly touches his friend: 'Come, let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love. They leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights. The two old friends go outside, holding each other's hands.
Baraj says with hands clasped, 'Master, our days are gone. New men have come now, new styles and customs in the world. The court we kept is deserted - only the two of us are left. Don't ask anyone to listen to me now, I beg you at your feet, my lord. The singer along does not make a song, there has to be someone who hears: One man opens his throat to sing, the other sings in his mind. Only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound; Only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves.
Only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world. Where there is no love, where listeners are dumb, there never can be song.'

I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver. With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain. In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game.

When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.'

Shall any foolish veil divide my longing from my bliss? Shall any fragile curtain hide your beauty from my kiss?
What war is this of Thee and Me? Give o'er the wanton strife, You are the heart within my heart, the life within my life.

In Praise Of Henna

A KOKILA called from a henna-spray: Lira! liree! Lira! liree! Hasten, maidens, hasten away To gather the leaves of the henna-tree. Send your pitchers afloat on the tide, Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old, Grind them in mortars of amber and gold, The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree.
A kokila called from a henna-spray: Lira! liree! Lira! liree! Hasten maidens, hasten away To gather the leaves of the henna-tree. The tilka's red for the brow of a bride, And betel-nut's red for lips that are sweet; But, for lily-like fingers and feet, The red, the red of the henna-tree.

In Salutation To The Eternal Peace

Men say the world is full of fear and hate, And all life's ripening harvest-fields await The restless sickle of relentless fate.
But I, sweet Soul, rejoice that I was born, When from the climbing terraces of corn I watch the golden orioles of Thy morn.
What care I for the world's desire and pride, Who know the silver wings that gleam and glide, The homing pigeons of Thine eventide?
What care I for the world's loud weariness, Who dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless With delicate sheaves of mellow silences?
Say, shall I heed dull presages of doom, Or dread the rumoured loneliness and gloom, The mute and mythic terror of the tomb?
For my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee, O inmost wind of living ecstasy! O intimate essence of eternity!

HERE, O my heart, let us burn the dear dreams that are dead, Here in this wood let us fashion a funeral pyre Of fallen white petals and leaves that are mellow and red, Here let us burn them in noon's flaming torches of fire.
We are weary, my heart, we are weary, so long we have borne The heavy loved burden of dreams that are dead, let us rest, Let us scatter their ashes away, for a while let us mourn; We will rest, O my heart, till the shadows are gray in the west.
But soon we must rise, O my heart, we must wander again Into the war of the world and the strife of the throng; Let us rise, O my heart, let us gather the dreams that remain, We will conquer the sorrow of life with the sorrow of song.

Indian Dancer

EYES ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light; O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire, And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.
The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gemtangled hair, And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet; Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air, And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.
Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers, Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant choir; Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours, Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire!

He
Lift up the veils that darken the delicate moon of thy glory and grace, Withhold not, O love, from the night of my longing the joy of thy luminous face, Give me a spear of the scented keora guarding thy pinioned curls, Or a silken thread from the fringes that trouble the dream of thy glimmering pearls; Faint grows my soul with thy tresses' perfume and the song of thy anklets' caprice, Revive me, I pray, with the magical nectar that dwells in the flower of thy kiss.
She
How shall I yield to the voice of thy pleading, how shall I grant thy prayer, Or give thee a rose-red silken tassel, a scented leaf from my hair? Or fling in the flame of thy heart's desire the veils that cover my face, Profane the law of my father's creed for a foe of my father's race? Thy kinsmen have broken our sacred altars and slaughtered our sacred kine, The feud of old faiths and the blood of old battles sever thy people and mine.
He
What are the sins of my race, Beloved, what are my people to thee? And what are thy shrines, and kine and kindred, what are thy gods to me? Love recks not of feuds and bitter follies, of stranger, comrade or kin, Alike in his ear sound the temple bells and the cry of the muezzin. For Love shall cancel the ancient wrong and conquer the ancient rage,
Redeem with his tears the memoried sorrow that sullied a bygone age.

Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall.
From trellised balconies, languid and luminous Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous.
Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes, Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains.
Round the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades Blend with the music of cymbals and serenades.
Over the city bridge Night comes majestical, Borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival. ",i,Fear

Ode To H.H. The Nizam Of Hyderabad
DEIGN, Prince, my tribute to receive, This lyric offering to your name, Who round your jewelled scepter bind The lilies of a poet's fame; Beneath whose sway concordant dwell The peoples whom your laws embrace, In brotherhood of diverse creeds, And harmony of diverse race:
The votaries of the Prophet's faith, Of whom you are the crown and chief And they, who bear on Vedic brows Their mystic symbols of belief; And they, who worshipping the sun, Fled o'er the old Iranian sea; And they, who bow to Him who trod The midnight waves of Galilee.
Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad The splendours of your court recall, The torches of a Thousand Nights Blaze through a single festival; And Saki-singers down the streets, Pour for us, in a stream divine, From goblets of your love-ghazals The rapture of your Sufi wine.
Prince, where your radiant cities smile, Grim hills their sombre vigils keep, Your ancient forests hoard and hold The legends of their centuried sleep; Your birds of peace white-pinioned float O'er ruined fort and storied plain, Your faithful stewards sleepless guard The harvests of your gold and grain.
God give you joy, God give you grace To shield the truth and smite the wrong,
To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth. To cherish faith and foster song. So may the lustre of your days Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung, Your name within a nation's prayer, Your music on a nation's tongue.

Lone in the light of that magical grove, I felt the stars of the spirits of Love Gather and gleam round my delicate youth, And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth; To quench my longing I bent me low By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow In that magical wood in the land of sleep.

When the earth falters and the waters swoon With the implacable radiance of noon, And in dim shelters koïls hush their notes, And the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats Craves liquid succour from the cruel heat, Buy fruit, buy fruit, steals down the panting street.
When twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars, Unfurls a sudden canopy of stars, When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit On white roof-terraces where lovers sit Drinking together of life's poignant sweet, Buy flowers, buy flowers, floats down the singing street.

He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide in his breast our lives.
Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and the scent of the mango grove, And sweet are the sands at the full o' the moon with the sound of the voices we love; But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam's glee; Row, brothers, row to the edge of the verge, where the low sky mates with the sea.

The Queen's Rival

QUEEN GULNAAR sat on her ivory bed, Around her countless treasures were spread;
Her chamber walls were richly inlaid With agate, porphory, onyx and jade;
The tissues that veiled her delicate breast, Glowed with the hues of a lapwing's crest;
But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed ""O King, my heart is unsatisfied.""
King Feroz bent from his ebony seat: ""Is thy least desire unfulfilled, O Sweet?
""Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent To clear the sky of thy discontent.""
""I tire of my beauty, I tire of this Empty splendour and shadowless bliss;
""With none to envy and none gainsay, No savour or salt hath my dream or day.""
Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose: ""Give me a rival, O King Feroz.""

""Send forth my messengers over the sea, To seek seven beautiful brides for me;
""Radiant of feature and regal of mien, Seven handmaids meet for the Persian Queen."" .....
Seven new moon tides at the Vesper call, King Feroz led to Queen Gulnaar's hall
A young queen eyed like the morning star: ""I bring thee a rival, O Queen Gulnaar.""
But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: ""O King, my heart is unsatisfied.""
Seven queens shone round her ivory bed, Like seven soft gems on a silken thread,
Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower, Like seven bright petals of Beauty's flower
Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose ""Where is my rival, O King Feroz?""

And still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: ""O King, my heart is unsatisfied.""

Ran to her knee like a wildwood fay, And plucked from her hand the mirror away.
Quickly she set on her own light curls Her mother's fillet with fringes of pearls;
Quickly she turned with a child's caprice
And pressed on the mirror a swift, glad kiss.
Queen Gulnaar laughed like a tremulous rose: ""Here is my rival, O King Feroz.""

'Thou shalt drink deep of joy and fame, And love shall burn thee like a fire, And pain shall cleanse thee like a flame, To purge the dross from thy desire.

Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure, Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure. Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing, Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?
The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow, The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow. Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling; O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.

Wandering Singers

WHERE the voice of the wind calls our wandering feet, Through echoing forest and echoing street, With lutes in our hands ever-singing we roam, All men are our kindred, the world is our home. Our lays are of cities whose lustre is shed, The laughter and beauty of women long dead; The sword of old battles, the crown of old kings, And happy and simple and sorrowful things. What hope shall we gather, what dreams shall we sow? Where the wind calls our wandering footsteps we go. No love bids us tarry, no joy bids us wait: The voice of the wind is the voice of our fate.

Coromandel Fishers

Rise, brothers, rise; the wakening skies pray to the morning light, The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn like a child that has cried all night. Come, let us gather our nets from the shore and set our catamarans free, To capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for we are the kings of the sea!
No longer delay, let us hasten away in the track of the sea gull's call, The sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother, the waves are our comrades all. What though we toss at the fall of the sun where the hand of the sea-god drives?
He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide in his breast our lives.
Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and the scent of the mango grove, And sweet are the sands at the full o' the moon with the sound of the voices we love; But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam's glee; Row, brothers, row to the edge of the verge, where the low sky mates with the sea.

Dear eyes, good-night, In golden light The stars around you gleam; On you I press With soft caress A little lovely dream.

Damayante To Nala In The Hour Of Exile

SHALT thou be conquered of a human fate My liege, my lover, whose imperial head Hath never bent in sorrow of defeat? Shalt thou be vanquished, whose imperial feet Have shattered armies and stamped empires dead? Who shall unking thee, husband of a queen? Wear thou thy majesty inviolate. Earth's glories flee of human eyes unseen, Earth's kingdoms fade to a remembered dream, But thine henceforth shall be a power supreme,
Dazzling command and rich dominion, The winds thy heralds and thy vassals all The silver-belted planets and the sun. Where'er the radiance of thy coming fall, Shall dawn for thee her saffron footcloths spread, Sunset her purple canopies and red, In serried splendour, and the night unfold Her velvet darkness wrought with starry gold For kingly raiment, soft as cygnet-down. My hair shall braid thy temples like a crown Of sapphires, and my kiss upon thy brows Like çithar-music lull thee to repose, Till the sun yield thee homage of his light.
O king, thy kingdom who from thee can wrest? What fate shall dare uncrown thee from this breast, O god-born lover, whom my love doth gird And armour with impregnable delight Of Hope's triumphant keen flame-carven sword?

I have gathered my dreams in a silver air Between the gold and the blue And wrapped them softly and left them there, My jewelled dreams of you.
I had hoped to build a rainbow bridge Marrying the soil to the sky And sow in this dancing planet midge The moods of infinity.
But too bright were our heavens, too far away, Too frail their ethereal stuff; Too splendid and sudden our light could not stay; The roots were not deep enough.
He who would bring the heavens here Must descend himself into clay And the burden of earthly nature bear And tread the dolorous way.
Coercing my godhead I have come down Here on the sordid earth, Ignorant, labouring, human grown Twixt the gates of death and birth.
I have been digging deep and long Mid a horror of filth and mire A bed for the golden river's song, A home for the deathless fire.
I have laboured and suffered in Matter's night To bring the fire to man; But the hate of hell and human spite Are my meed since the world began.
For man's mind is the dupe of his animal self; Hoping its lusts to win, He harbours within him a grisly Elf Enamoured of sorrow and sin.
The grey Elf shudders from heaven's flame And from all things glad and pure; Only by pleasure and passion and pain His drama can endure.
All around is darkness and strife; For the lamps that men call suns Are but halfway gleams on this stumbling life Cast by the Undying Ones.
Man lights his little torches of hope That lead to a failing edge; A fragment of Truth is his widest scope, An inn his pilgrimage.
The Truth of truths men fear and deny, The Light of lights they refuse; To ignorant gods they lift their cry Or a demon altar choose.
All that was found must again be sought, Each enemy slain revives, Each battle for ever is fought and refought Through vistas of fruitless lives.
My gaping wounds are a thousand and one And the Titan kings assail, But I cannot rest till my task is done And wrought the eternal will.
How they mock and sneer, both devils and men! 'Thy hope is Chimera's head Painting the sky with its fiery stain; Thou shalt fall and thy work lie dead.
'Who art thou that babblest of heavenly ease And joy and golden room To us who are waifs on inconscient seas And bound to life's iron doom?
'This earth is ours, a field of Night
For our petty flickering fires. How shall it brook the scared Light Or suffer a god's desires?
'Come, let us slay him and end his course! Then shall our hearts have release From the burden and call of his glory and force And the curb of his wide white peace.'
But the god is there in my mortal breast Who wrestles with error and fate And tramples a road through mire and waste For the nameless Immaculate.
A voice cried, 'Go where none have gone! Dig deeper, deeper yet Till thou reach the grim foundation stone And knock at the keyless gate.'
I saw that a falsehood was planted deep At the very root of things Where the grey Sphinx guards God's riddle sleep On the Dragon's outspread wings.
I left the surface gods of mind And life's unsatisfied seas And plunged through the body's alleys blind To the nether mysteries.
I have delved through the dumb Earth's dreadful heart And heard her black mass' bell. I have seen the source whence her agonies part And the inner reason of hell.
Above me the dragon murmurs moan And the goblin voices flit; I have pierced the Void where Thought was born, I have walked in the bottomless pit.
On a desperate stair my feet have trod Armoured with boundless peace, Bringing the fires of the splendour of God
Into the human abyss.
He who I am was with me still; All veils are breaking now. I have heard His voice and borne His will on my vast untroubled brow.
The gulf twixt the depths and the heights is bridged And the golden waters pour Down the sapphire mountain rainbow-ridged And glimmer from shore to shore.
Heaven's fire is lit in the breast of the earth And the undying suns here burn; Through a wonder cleft in the bounds of birth The incarnate spirits yearn
Like flames to the kingdoms of Truth and Bliss: Down a gold-red stair-way wend The radiant children of Paradise Clarioning darkness's end.
A little more and the new life's doors Shall be carved in silver light With its aureate roof and mosaic floors In a great world bare and bright.
I shall leave my dreams in their argent air, For in a raiment of gold and blue There shall move on the earth embodied and fair The living truth of you.

Not in the petty circle of cities Cramped by your doors and your walls I dwell; Over me God is blue in the welkin, Against me the wind and the storm rebel.
I sport with solitude here in my regions, Of misadventure have made me a friend. Who would live largely? Who would live freely? Here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.

Will you then speak of the one as a slave and a wanton, The other too bare? But God is the only slave and the only monarch We declare.

Mother Of Dreams

Goddess supreme, Mother of Dream, by thy ivory doors when thou standest, Who are they then that come down unto men in thy visions that troop, group upon group, down the path of the shadows slanting? Dream after dream, they flash and they gleam with the flame of the stars still around them; Shadows at thy side in a darkness ride where the wild fires dance, stars glow and glance and the random meteor glistens; There are voices that cry to their kin who reply; voices sweet, at the heart they beat and ravish the soul as it listens.
What then are these lands and these golden sands and these seas more radiant than earth can imagine? Who are those that pace by the purple waves that race to the cliff-bound floor of thy jasper shore under skies in which mystery muses, Lapped in moonlight not of our night or plunged in sunshine that is not diurnal? Who are they coming thy Oceans roaming with sails whose strands are not made by hands, an unearthly wind advances? Why do they join in a mystic line with those on the sands linking hands in strange and stately dances?
Thou in the air, with a flame in thy hair, the whirl of thy wonders watching, Holdest the night in thy ancient right, Mother divine, hyacinthine, with a girdle of beauty defended. Sworded with fire, attracting desire, thy tenebrous kingdom thou keepest, Starry-sweet, with the moon at thy feet, now hidden now seen the clouds between in the gloom and the drift of thy tresses. Only to those whom thy fancy chose, O thou heart-free, is it given to see thy witchcraft and feel thy caresses.
Open the gate where thy children wait in their world of a beauty undarkened. High-throned on a cloud, victorious, proud I have espied Maghavan ride when the armies of wind are behind him; Food has been given for my tasting from heaven and fruit of immortal sweetness; I have drunk wine of the kingdoms divine and have healed the change of music strange from a lyre which our hands cannot master, Doors have swung wide in the chambers of pride where the Gods reside and the Apsaras dance in their circles faster and faster.
For thou art she whom we first can see when we pass the bounds of the mortal; There at the gates of the heavenly states thou hast planted thy wand enchanted over the head of the Yogin waving. From thee are the dream and the shadows that seem and the fugitive lights that delude us; Thine is the shade in which visions are made; sped by thy hands from celestial lands come the souls that rejoice for ever. Into thy dream-worlds we pass or look in thy magic glass, then beyond thee we climb out of Space and Time to the peak of divine endeavour.

Only the river rippled, only hummed The languid murmuring bee, far-borne and slow, Emparadised in odours, only used The ringdove his divine heart-moving speech; But sweetest to my pleased and singing heart Thy voice, O coil, in the peepel tree.
O me! for pleasure turned to bitterest tears! O me! for the swift joy, too great to live, That only bloomed one hour! O wondrous day, That crowned the bliss of those delicious years. The vernal radiance of my lover's lips Was shut like a red rose upon my mouth, His voice was richer than the murmuring leaves, His love around me than the summer air. Five hours entangled in the coil's cry Lay my beloved twixt my happy breasts. O voice of tears! O sweetness uttering death! O lost ere yet that happy cry was still!
O tireless voice of spring! Again I lie In odorous gloom of trees; unseen and hear The windlark gurgles in the golden leaves, The woodworm spins in shrillness on the bough: Thou by the waters wailing to thy love, O chocrobacque! have comfort, since to thee The dawn brings sweetest recompense of tears And she thou lovest hears thy pain.

I am no more a vassal of flesh, A slave to Nature and her leaden rule; I am caught no more in the senses' narrow mesh. My soul unhorizoned widens to measureless sight, My body is God's happy living tool, My spirit a vast sun of deathless light.

Who

In the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest, Whose is the hand that has painted the glow? When the winds were asleep in the womb of the ether, Who was it roused them and bade them to blow?
He is lost in the heart, in the cavern of Nature, He is found in the brain where He builds up the thought: In the pattern and bloom of the flowers He is woven, In the luminous net of the stars He is caught.
In the strength of a man, in the beauty of woman, In the laugh of a boy, in the blush of a girl; The hand that sent Jupiter spinning through heaven, Spends all its cunning to fashion a curl.
There are His works and His veils and His shadows; But where is He then? by what name is He known? Is He Brahma or Vishnu? a man or a woman? Bodies or bodiless? twin or alone?
We have love for a boy who is dark and resplendent, A woman is lord of us, naked and fierce. We have seen Him a-muse on the snow of the mountains, We have watched Him at work in the heart of the spheres.
We will tell the whole world of His ways and His cunning; He has rapture of torture and passion and pain; He delights in our sorrow and drives us to weeping, Then lures with His joy and His beauty again.
All music is only the sound of His laughter, All beauty the smile of His passionate bliss; Our lives are His heart-beats, our rapture the bridal Of Radha and Krishna, our love is their kiss.
He is strength that is loud in the blare of the trumpets, And He rides in the car and He strikes in the spears; He slays without stint and is full of compassion; He wars for the world and its ultimate years.
In the sweep of the worlds, in the surge of the ages, Ineffable, mighty, majestic and pure, Beyond the last pinnacle seized by the thinker He is throned in His seats that for ever endure.
The Master of man and his infinite Lover, He is close to our hearts, had we vision to see; We are blind with our pride and the pomp of our passions, We are bound in our thoughts where we hold ourselves free.
It is He in the sun who is ageless and deathless, And into the midnight His shadow is thrown; When darkness was blind and engulfed within darkness, He was seated within it immense and alone.

Evolution (Revised)

I passed into a lucent still abode And saw as in a mirror crystalline An ancient Force ascending serpentine The unhasting spirals of the aeonic road.
Earth was a cradle for the arriving god And man but a half-dark half-luminous sign Of the transition of the veiled Divine From Matter's sleep and the tormented load
Of ignorant life and death to the Spirit's light. Mind liberated swam Light's ocean vast, And life escaped from its grey tortured line;
I saw Matter illumining its parent Night. The soul could feel into infinity cast Timeless God-bliss the heart incarnadine.

Fate (Savitri, Part Two, Book Seven)

Fate followed her foreseen immutable road. Man's hopes and longings build the journeying wheels That bear the body of his destiny And lead his blind will towards an unknown goal. His fate within him shapes his acts and rules; Its face and form already are born in him, Its parentage is in his secret soul: Here Matter seems to mould the body's life And the soul follows where its nature drives. Nature and Fate compel his free-will's choice. But greater spirits this balance can reverse And make the soul the artist of its fate. This is the mystic truth our ignorance hides:

Song Of The Sanyasin

Wake up the note! the song that had its birth Far off, where worldly taint could never reach, In mountain caves and glades of forest deep, Whose calm no sigh for lust or wealth or fame Could ever dare to break; where rolled the stream Of knowledge, truth, and bliss that follows both. Sing high that note, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Strike off thy fetters! Bonds that bind thee down, Of shining gold, or darker, baser ore; Love, hate--good, bad--and all the dual throng, Know, slave is slave, caressed or whipped, not free; For fetters, though of gold, are not less strong to bind; Then off with them, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Let darkness go; the will-o'-the-wisp that leads With blinking light to pile more gloom on gloom. This thirst for life, for ever quench; it drags From birth to death, and death to birth, the soul. He conquers all who conquers self. Know this And never yield, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
'Who sows must reap, ' they say, 'and cause must bring The sure effect; good, good; bad, bad; and none Escape the law. But whoso wears a form Must wear the chain.' Too true; but far beyond Both name and form is Atman, ever free. Know thou art That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
They know not truth who dream such vacant dreams As father, mother, children, wife, and friend. The sexless Self! whose father He? whose child? Whose friend, whose foe is He who is but One? The Self is all in all, none else exists; And thou art That, Sannyasin bold! Say--
'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
There is but One--The Free--The Knower--Self! Without a name, without a form or stain. In Him is Maya dreaming all this dream. The witness, He appears as nature, soul. Know thou art That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Where seekest thou? That freedom, friend, this world Nor that can give. In books and temples vain Thy search. Thine only is the hand that holds The rope that drags thee on. Then cease lament, Let go thy hold, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Say, 'Peace to all: From me no danger be To aught that lives. In those that dwell on high. In those that lowly creep, I am the Self in all! All life both here and there, do I renounce, All heavens and earths and hells, all hopes and fears.' Thus cut thy bonds, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Heed then no more how body lives or goes, Its task is done. Let Karma float it down; Let one put garlands on, another kick This frame; say naught. No praise or blame can be Where praiser praised, and blamer blamed are one. Thus be thou calm, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Truth never comes where lust and fame and greed Of gain reside. No man who thinks of woman As his wife can ever perfect be; Nor he who owns the least of things, nor he Whom anger chains, can ever pass thro' Maya's gates. So, give these up, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Have thou no home. What home can hold thee, friend? The sky thy roof, the grass thy bed; and food
What chance may bring, well cooked or ill, judge not. No food or drink can taint that noble Self Which knows Itself. Like rolling river free Thou ever be, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Few only know the truth. The rest will hate And laugh at thee, great one; but pay no heed. Go thou, the free, from place to place, and help Them out of darkness, Maya's veil. Without The fear of pain or search for pleasure, go Beyond them both, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '
Thus, day by day, till Karma's powers spent Release the soul for ever. No more is birth, Nor I, nor thou, nor God, nor man. The 'I' Has All become, the All is 'I' and Bliss. Know thou art That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- 'Om Tat Sat, Om! '

The Song Of The Free

The wounded snake its hood unfurls, The flame stirred up doth blaze, The desert air resounds the calls Of heart-struck lion's rage.
The cloud puts forth it deluge strength When lightning cleaves its breast, When the soul is stirred to its in most depth Great ones unfold their best.
Let eyes grow dim and heart grow faint, And friendship fail and love betray, Let Fate its hundred horrors send, And clotted darkness block the way.
All nature wear one angry frown, To crush you out - still know, my soul, You are Divine. March on and on, Nor right nor left but to the goal.
Nor angel I, nor man, nor brute, Nor body, mind, nor he nor she, The books do stop in wonder mute To tell my nature; I am He.
Before the sun, the moon, the earth, Before the stars or comets free, Before e'en time has had its birth, I was, I am, and I will be.
The beauteous earth, the glorious sun, The calm sweet moon, the spangled sky, Causation's law do make them run; They live in bonds, in bonds they die.
And mind its mantle dreamy net Cast o'er them all and holds them fast. In warp and woof of thought are set, Earth, hells, and heavens, or worst or best.
Know these are but the outer crust All space and time, all effect, cause. I am beyond all sense, all thoughts, The witness of the universe.
Not two nor many, 'tis but one, And thus in me all me's I have; I cannot hate, I cannot shun Myself from me, I can but love.
From dreams awake, from bonds be free, Be not afraid. This mystery, My shadow, cannot frighten me, Know once for all that I am He.

The lakes are opening wide in love Their hundred thousand lotus-eyes To welcome thee, with all their depth.
All hail to thee, thou Lord of Light! A welcome new to thee, today, O sun! today thou sheddest LIBERTY! Bethink thee how the world did wait, And search for thee, through time and clime.
Some gave up home and love of friends, And went in quest of thee, self banished, Through dreary oceans, through primeval forests, Each step a struggle for their life or death;
Then came the day when work bore fruit, And worship, love, and sacrifice, Fulfilled, accepted, and complete. Then thou, propitious, rose to shed The light of FREEDOM on mankind.
Move on, O Lord, on thy resistless path! Till thy high noon o'erspreads the world. Till every land reflects thy light, Till men and women, with uplifted head, Behold their shackles broken, and Know, in springing joy, their life renewed!

One bending low with load of life -- That meant no joy, but suffering harsh and hard -- And wending on his way through dark and dismal paths Without a flash of light from brain or heart To give a moment's cheer, till the line That marks out pain from pleasure, death from life, And good from what is evil was well-nigh wiped from sight, Saw, one blessed night, a faint but beautiful ray of light Descend to him. He knew not what or wherefrom, But called it God and worshipped. Hope, an utter stranger, came to him and spread Through all his parts, and life to him meant more Than he could ever dream and covered all he knew, Nay, peeped beyond his world. The Sages Winked, and smiled, and called it 'superstition'. But he did feel its power and peace And gently answered back --
'O Blessed Superstition! '

One drunk with wine of wealth and power And health to enjoy them both, whirled on His maddening course, till the earth, he thought, Was made for him, his pleasure-garden, and man, The crawling worm, was made to find him sport, Till the thousand lights of joy, with pleasure fed, That flickered day and night before his eyes, With constant change of colours, began to blur His sight, and cloy his senses; till selfishness, Like a horny growth, had spread all o'er his heart; And pleasure meant to him no more than pain, Bereft of feeling; and life in the sense, So joyful, precious once, a rotting corpse between his arms,
Which he forsooth would shun, but more he tried, the more It clung to him; and wished, with frenzied brain, A thousand forms of death, but quailed before the charm, Then sorrow came -- and Wealth and Power went -- And made him kinship find with all the human race In groans and tears, and though his friends would laugh, His lips would speak in grateful accents --

One born with healthy frame -- but not of will That can resist emotions deep and strong, Nor impulse throw, surcharged with potent strength -- And just the sort that pass as good and kind, Beheld that he was safe, whilst others long And vain did struggle 'gainst the surging waves. Till, morbid grown, his mind could see, like flies That seek the putrid part, but what was bad. Then Fortune smiled on him, and his foot slipped. That ope'd his eyes for e'er, and made him find That stones and trees ne'er break the law, But stones and trees remain; that man alone Is blest with power to fight and conquer Fate, Transcending bounds and laws. From him his passive nature fell, and life appeared As broad and new, and broader, newer grew, Till light ahead began to break, and glimpse of That Where Peace Eternal dwells -- yet one can only reach By wading through the sea of struggles -- courage-giving, came. Then looking back on all that made him kin To stocks and stones, and on to what the world Had shunned him for, his fall, he blessed the fall, And with a joyful heart, declared it --

Wrenching trees by the roots, Sweeping all from the path.

To reach the pitchy sky. The flash of lurid light
Reveals on every side A thousand, thousand shades
Of Death begrimed and black -- Scattering plagues and sorrows,
Dancing mad with joy, Come, Mother, come!
For Terror is Thy name, Death is in Thy breath,
And every shaking step Destroys a world for e'er. Thou 'Time', the All-Destroyer!

My Play Is Done

Ever rising, ever falling with the waves of time, still rolling on I go From fleeting scene to scene ephemeral, with life's currents' ebb and flow.
Oh! I am sick of this unending force; these shows they please no more, This ever running, never reaching, nor e'en a distant glimpse of shore!
From life to life I'm waiting at the gates, alas, they open not. Dim are my eyes with vain attempt to catch one ray long sought.
On little life's high, narrow bridge I stand and see below The struggling, crying, laughing throng. For what? No one can know.
In front yon gates stand frowning dark, and say: `No farther away, This is the limit; tempt not Fate, bear it as best you may;
Go, mix with them and drink this cup and be as mad as they. Who dares to know but comes to grief; stop then, and with them stay.'
Alas for me, I cannot rest. This floating bubble, earthIts hollow form, its hollow name, its hollow death and birth-
For me is nothing. How i long to get beyond the crust Of name and form! Ah, open the gates; to me they open must.
Open the gates of light, O Mother, to me Thy tired son. I long, oh, long to return home! Mother, my play is done.
You sent me out in the dark to play and wore a frightful mask; Then hope departed, terror came, and play became a task.
Tossed to and fro, from wave to wave in this seething, surging sea Of passions strong and sorrows deep, grief is, and joy to be.
Where life is living death, alas! and death- who knows but `tis Another start, another round of this old wheel of grief and bliss?
Where children dream bright, golden dreams, too soon to find them dust, And aye look back to hope long lost and life a mass of rust!
Too late, the knowledge age doth gain; scare from the wheel we're gone. When fresh, young lives put their strength to the wheel, which thus goes on
From day to day and year to year. 'Tis but delusion's toy, False hope its motor; desire, nave; its spokes are grief and joy.
I go adrift and know not whither. Save from this fire! Rescue me, merciful Mother, from floating with desire!
Turn not to me Thy awful face, 'tis more than I can bear, Be merciful and kind to me, to chide my faults forbear.
Take me, O Mother, to those shores where strifes for ever cease; Beyond all sorrows, beyond tears, beyond e'en earthly bliss;
Whose glory neither sun, nor moon, nor stars that twinkle bright, Nor flash of lightning can express. They but reflect its light.
Let never more delusive dreams veil off Thy face from me. My play is done; O Mother, break my chains and make me free!

There light clouds spread, heaping up spun cotton; See next a huge snake, then a strong lion; Again, behold a couple locked in love. All vanish, at last, in the vapoury sky.

It is beauty never seen, And love that stands alone, It is song that lives un-sung, And knowledge never known.

Like a child in the wildest forest lost I have cried and cried alone, 'Where art Thou gone, my God, my love? The echo answered, 'gone.'
And days and nights and years then passed A fire was in the brain, I knew not when day changed in night The heart seemed rent in twain. I laid me down on Ganges's shore, Exposed to sun and rain; With burning tears I laid the dust And wailed with waters' roar.
I called on all the holy names Of every clime and creed. 'Show me the way, in mercy, ye Great ones who have reached the goal.'
Years then passed in bitter cry, Each moment seemed an age, Till one day midst my cries and groans Some one seemed calling me.
A gentle soft and soothing voice That said 'my son' 'my son', That seemed to thrill in unison With all the chords of my soul.
I stood on my feet and tried to find The place the voice came from; I searched and searched and turned to see Round me, before, behind,
Again, again it seemed to speak The voice divine to me. In rapture all my soul was hushed, Entranced, enthralled in bliss.
A flash illumined all my soul; The heart of my heart opened wide. O joy, O bliss, what do I find! My love, my love you are here And you are here, my love, my all!
And I was searching thee From all eternity you were there Enthroned in majesty! From that day forth, wherever I roam, I feel Him standing by O'ver hill and dale, high mount and vale, Far far away and high.
The moon's soft light, the stars so bright, The glorious orb of day, He shines in them; His beauty - might Reflected lights are they. The majestic morn, the melting eve, The boundless billowing sea, In nature's beauty, songs of birds, I see through them - it is He.
When dire calamity seizes me, The heart seems weak and faint, All nature seems to crush me down, With laws that never bend. Meseems I hear Thee whispering sweet My love, 'I am near', 'I am near'. My heart gets strong. With thee, my love, A thousand deaths no fear. Thou speakest in the mother's lay Thou shuts the babies eye, When innocent children laugh and play, I see Thee standing by.
When holy friendship shakes the hand,
He stands between them too; He pours the nectar in mother's kiss And the baby's sweet 'mama'. Thou wert my God with prophets old, All creeds do come from Thee, The Vedas, Bible, and Koran bold Sing Thee in Harmony.

For here beside thee, as a guard 'Twas he commanded me to stay, And dangers with my life to ward If they should come across thy way. Send me not hence, for in this wood Bands scattered of the giants lurk, Who on their wrongs and vengeance brood, And wait the hour their will to work.'

A plea for lingering! Now I know What thou art, Lakshman! And I feel Far better were an open foe. Art thou a coward? I have seen Thy bearing in the battle-fray Where flew the death-fraught arrows keen, Else had I judged thee so today.

'But then thy leader stood beside! Dazzles the cloud when shines the sun, Reft of his radiance, see it glide A shapeless mass of vapours dun; So of thy courage, - or if not, The matter is far darker dyed, What makes thee loth to leave this spot? Is there a motive thou wouldst hide?

'He perishes - well, let him die! His wife henceforth shall be mine own! Can that thought deep imbedded lie Within thy heart's most secret zone! Search well and see! one brother takes His kingdom, - one would take his wife! A fair partition! - But it makes Me shudder, and abhor my life.

'Art thou in secret league with those Who from his hope the kingdom rent? A spy from his ignoble foes To track him in his banishment? And wouldst thou at his death rejoice? I know thou wouldst, or sure ere now When first thou heardst that well known voice Thou shouldst have run to aid, I trow.

'Learn this, - whatever comes may come, But I shall not survive my Love, Of all my thoughts here is the sum!
Witness it gods in heaven above. If fire can burn, or water drown, I follow him: - choose what thou wilt Truth with its everlasting crown, Or falsehood, treachery, and guilt.

'Remain here with a vain pretence Of shielding me from wrong and shame, Or go and die in his defence And leave behind a noble name. Choose what thou wilt, - I urge no more, My pathway lies before me clear, I did not know thy mind before, I know thee now, - and have no fear.'

She said and proudly from him turned, Was this the gentle Sita? No. Flames from her eyes shot forth and burned, The tears therein had ceased to flow. 'Hear me, O Queen, ere I depart, No longer can I bear thy words, They lacerate my inmost heart And torture me, like poisoned swords.

'Have I deserved this at thine hand? Of lifelong loyalty and truth Is this the meed? I understand Thy feelings, Sita, and in sooth I blame thee not, - but thou mightst be Less rash in judgement, Look! I go, Little I care what comes to me Wert thou but safe, - God keep thee so!

'In going hence I disregard The plainest orders of my chief, A deed for me, - a soldier, - hard And deeply painful, but thy grief And language, wild and wrong, allow
No other course. Mine be the crime, And mine alone. - but oh, do thou Think better of me from this time.

'Here with an arrow, lo, I trace A magic circle ere I leave, No evil thing within this space May come to harm thee or to grieve. Step not, for aught, across the line, Whatever thou mayst see or hear, So shalt thou balk the bad design Of every enemy I fear.

'And now farewell! What thou hast said, Though it has broken quite my heart, So that I wish I were dead I would before, O Queen, we part, Freely forgive, for well I know That grief and fear have made thee wild, We part as friends, - is it not so?' And speaking thus he sadly smiled.

'And oh ye sylvan gods that dwell Among these dim and sombre shades, Whose voices in the breezes swell And blend with noises of cascades, Watch over Sita, whom alone I leave, and keep her safe from harm, Till we return unto our own, I and my brother, arm in arm.

'For though ill omens round us rise And frighten her dear heart, I feel That he is safe. Beneath the skies His equal is not, - and his heel Shall tread all adversaries down, Whoeve'r they may chance to be. Farewell, O Sita! Blessings crown
And peace for ever rest with thee!'
He said, and straight his weapons took His bow and arrows pointed keen, Kind, - nay, indulgent, - was his look, No trace of anger, there was seen, Only a sorrow dark, that seemed To deepen his resolve to dare All dangers. Hoarse the vulture screamed, As out he strode with dauntless air.

Love Came To Flora Asking For A Flower

Love came to Flora asking for a flower That would of flowers be undisputed queen, The lily and the rose, long, long had been Rivals for that high honor. Bards of power Had sung their claims. 'The rose can never tower Like the pale lily with her Juno mien' 'But is the lily lovelier?' Thus between Flower-factions rang the strife in Psyche's bower. 'Give me a flower delicious as the rose And stately as the lily in her pride' But of what color?' - 'Rose-red,' Love first chose, Then prayed - 'No, lily-white - or, both provide;' And Flora gave the lotus, 'rose-red' dyed, And 'lily-white' - the queenliest flower that blows.

Our Casuarina Tree

LIKE a huge Python, winding round and round The rugged trunk, indented deep with scars, Up to its very summit near the stars, A creeper climbs, in whose embraces bound No other tree could live. But gallantly The giant wears the scarf, and flowers are hung In crimson clusters all the boughs among, Whereon all day are gathered bird and bee; And oft at nights the garden overflows With one sweet song that seems to have no close, Sung darkling from our tree, while men repose.
When first my casement is wide open thrown At dawn, my eyes delighted on it rest; Sometimes, and most in winter,--on its crest A gray baboon sits statue-like alone Watching the sunrise; while on lower boughs His puny offspring leap about and play; And far and near kokilas hail the day; And to their pastures wend our sleepy cows; And in the shadow, on the broad tank cast By that hoar tree, so beautiful and vast, The water-lilies spring, like snow enmassed.
But not because of its magnificence Dear is the Casuarina to my soul: Beneath it we have played; though years may roll, O sweet companions, loved with love intense, For your sakes, shall the tree be ever dear. Blent with your images, it shall arise In memory, till the hot tears blind mine eyes! What is that dirge-like murmur that I hear Like the sea breaking on a shingle-beach? It is the tree's lament, an eerie speech, That haply to the unknown land may reach.
Unknown, yet well-known to the eye of faith! Ah, I have heard that wail far, far away In distant lands, by many a sheltered bay,
When slumbered in his cave the water-wraith And the waves gently kissed the classic shore Of France or Italy, beneath the moon, When earth lay trancèd in a dreamless swoon: And every time the music rose,--before Mine inner vision rose a form sublime, Thy form, O Tree, as in my happy prime I saw thee, in my own loved native clime.
Therefore I fain would consecrate a lay Unto thy honor, Tree, beloved of those Who now in blessed sleep for aye repose,-- Dearer than life to me, alas, were they! Mayst thou be numbered when my days are done With deathless trees--like those in Borrowdale, Under whose awful branches lingered pale ""Fear, trembling Hope, and Death, the skeleton, And Time the shadow;"" and though weak the verse That would thy beauty fain, oh, fain rehearse, May Love defend thee from Oblivion's curse.

Sonnet

A sea of foliage girds our garden round, But not a sea of dull unvaried green, Sharp contrasts of all colors here are seen; The light-green graceful tamarinds abound Amid the mango clumps of green profound, And palms arise, like pillars gray, between; And o'er the quiet pools the seemuls lean, Red-red, and startling like a trumpet's sound. But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes Into a cup of silver. One might swoon Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze On a primeval Eden, in amaze.

And solemn warnings from its lusty throat Tis like a wakeful soldier, - mine, alas! The soul-bell in me, can but give one cry, Like that, a wounded soldier - o'er whom pass Riders and horses, and around whom lie The dead and dying in a tangled mass Utters, unable or to move or die.

Now to sow the task is set. Soon shall come a time to reap. Marches he along the plain To and fro, and scatters wide From his hands the precious grain; Muse I, as I see him stride. Darkness deepens. Fades the light. Now his gestures to mine eyes Are august; and strange, - his height Seems to touch the starry skies

The Young Captive

The budding shoot ripens unharmed by the scythe, Without fear of the press, on vine branches lithe, Through spring-tide the green clusters bloom. Is't strange, then, that I in my life's morning hour,
Though troubles like clouds on the dark present lower, Half-frighted shrink back from my doom ?
Let the stern-hearted stoic run boldly on death! I - I weep and I hope; to the north wind's chill breath
I bend, - then erect is my form! If days there are bitter, there are days also sweet, Enjoyment unmixed where on earth may we meet?
What ocean has never a storm? Illusions the fairest assuage half my pain, The walls of a prison enclose me in vain,
The strong wings of hope bear me far; So escapes from the net of the fowler the bird, So darts he through ether, while his music is heard
Like showers of sweet sound from a star. Comes Death unto me? I sleep tranquil and calm. And Peace when I waken stands by with her balm.
Remorse is the offspring of crimes; My welcome each morning smiles forth in all eyes, My presence is here, to sad brows, a surprise
Which kindles to pleasure at times. The end of my journey seemed so far to my view; Of the elm-trees which border the long avenue,
The nearest are only past by; At the banquet of life I have barely sat down. My lips have but pressed the bright foaming crown
Of the wine in my cup bubbling high. I am only in spring, - the harvest I'd see, From season to season like the sun I would be
Intent on completing my round; Shining bright in the garden, - its honour and queen; As yet but the beams of the morning I've seen,
I wait for eve's stillness profound. O Death, thou canst wait; leave, leave me to dream, And strike at the hearts where Despair is supreme,
And Shame hails thy dart as a boon! For me, Pales has arbours unknown to the throngs, The world has delights, the Muses have songs,
I wish not to perish too soon. A prisoner myself, broken-hearted and crushed, From my heart to my lips all my sympathies rushed,
And my lyre from its slumbers awoke; At these sorrows, these wishes, of a captive, I heard, And to rhyme and to measure I married each word
As softly and simply she spoke. Should this song of my prison hereafter inspire Some student with leisure her name to inquire,
This answer at least may be given, That grace marked her figure, her action, her speech, And such as lived near her, blameless might teach
That life is the best gift of heaven

Ballad for Gloom
Ezra Pound
For God, our God is a gallant foe
That playeth behind the veil.
 
I have loved my God as a child at heart
That seeketh deep bosoms for rest,
I have loved my God as a maid to man—
But lo, this thing is best:
 
To love your God as a gallant foe that plays behind the veil;
To meet your God as the night winds meet beyond Arcturus' pale.
 
I have played with God for a woman,
I have staked with my God for truth,
I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed—
His dice be not of ruth.
 
For I am made as a naked blade,
But hear ye this thing in sooth:
 
Who loseth to God as man to man
Shall win at the turn of the game.
I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet
But the ending is the same:
Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose
Shall win at the end of the game.
 
For God, our God is a gallant foe that playeth behind the veil.
Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail.

At the Fishhouses
Elizabeth Bishop
Although it is a cold evening,
down by one of the fishhouses
an old man sits netting,
his net, in the gloaming almost invisible,
a dark purple-brown,
and his shuttle worn and polished.
The air smells so strong of codfish
it makes one's nose run and one's eyes water.
The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs
and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up
to storerooms in the gables
for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on.
All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea,
swelling slowly as if considering spilling over,
is opaque, but the silver of the benches,
the lobster pots, and masts, scattered
among the wild jagged rocks,
is of an apparent translucence
like the small old buildings with an emerald moss
growing on their shoreward walls.
The big fish tubs are completely lined
with layers of beautiful herring scales
and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered
with creamy iridescent coats of mail,
with small iridescent flies crawling on them.
Up on the little slope behind the houses,
set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass,
is an ancient wooden capstan,
cracked, with two long bleached handles
and some melancholy stains, like dried blood,
where the ironwork has rusted.
The old man accepts a Lucky Strike.
He was a friend of my grandfather.
We talk of the decline in the population
and of codfish and herring
while he waits for a herring boat to come in.
There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb.
He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty,
from unnumbered fish with that black old knife,
the blade of which is almost worn away.
 
Down at the water's edge, at the place
where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp
descending into the water, thin silver
tree trunks are laid horizontally
across the gray stones, down and down
at intervals of four or five feet.
 
Cold dark deep and absolutely clear,
element bearable to no mortal,
to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly
I have seen here evening after evening.

He was curious about me. He was interested in music;
like me a believer in total immersion,
so I used to sing him Baptist hymns.
I also sang ""A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.""
He stood up in the water and regarded me
steadily, moving his head a little.
Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge
almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug
as if it were against his better judgment.
Cold dark deep and absolutely clear,
the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us,
the dignified tall firs begin.
Bluish, associating with their shadows,
a million Christmas trees stand
waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended
above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones.
I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same,
slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones,
icily free above the stones,
above the stones and then the world.
If you should dip your hand in,
your wrist would ache immediately,
your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn
as if the water were a transmutation of fire
that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame.
If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter,
then briny, then surely burn your tongue.
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be:
dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free,
drawn from the cold hard mouth
of the world, derived from the rocky breasts
forever, flowing and drawn, and since
our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.

Oh, here the air is sweet and still,
And soft's the grass to lie on;

And down the brook's another;
But, oh, the little hill they took, --

It has so many things to see,
They help it to forget.
 
But little hills that sit at home
So many hundred years,
Remember Greece, remember Rome,
Remember Mary's tears.

Grieves still the hill that I call mine, --

Overture to a Dance of Locomotives
William Carlos Williams
Men with picked voices chant the names
of cities in a huge gallery: promises
that pull through descending stairways
to a deep rumbling.
 
The rubbing feet
of those coming to be carried quicken a
grey pavement into soft light that rocks
to and fro, under the domed ceiling,
across and across from pale
earthcolored walls of bare limestone.
 
Covertly the hands of a great clock
go round and round! Were they to
move quickly and at once the whole
secret would be out and the shuffling
of all ants be done forever.
 
A leaning pyramid of sunlight, narrowing
out at a high window, moves by the clock:
disaccordant hands straining out from
a center: inevitable postures infinitely
repeated--
two--twofour--twoeight!
Porters in red hats run on narrow platforms.
This way ma'am!
--important not to take
the wrong train!
Lights from the concrete
ceiling hang crooked but--
Poised horizontal
on glittering parallels the dingy cylinders
packed with a warm glow--inviting entry--
pull against the hour. But brakes can
hold a fixed posture till--
The whistle!
 
Not twoeight. Not twofour. Two!
 
Gliding windows. Colored cooks sweating
in a small kitchen. Taillights--
 
In time: twofour!
In time: twoeight!
 
--rivers are tunneled: trestles
cross oozy swampland: wheels repeating
the same gesture remain relatively
stationary: rails forever parallel
return on themselves infinitely.
The dance is sure.

For it would split His Heart, to know it--

Carol Of Occupations
Walt Whitman
COME closer to me;
Push close, my lovers, and take the best I possess;
Yield closer and closer, and give me the best you possess.
 
This is unfinish'd business with me--How is it with you?
(I was chill'd with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper between us.)
 
Male and Female!
I pass so poorly with paper and types, I must pass with the contact
of bodies and souls.
 
American masses!
I do not thank you for liking me as I am, and liking the touch of
me--I know that it is good for you to do so.
 
This is the carol of occupations; 
In the labor of engines and trades, and the labor of fields, I find the developments,
And find the eternal meanings.
 
Workmen and Workwomen!
Were all educations, practical and ornamental, well display'd out of
me, what would it amount to?
Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman,
what would it amount to?
Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that
satisfy you?
 
The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms;
A man like me, and never the usual terms.
 
Neither a servant nor a master am I;
I take no sooner a large price than a small price--I will have my
own, whoever enjoys me; 
I will be even with you, and you shall be even with me.
 
If you stand at work in a shop, I stand as nigh as the nighest in the
same shop;
If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, I demand as
good as your brother or dearest friend;
If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must be
personally as welcome;
If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your
sake;
If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think I
cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd deeds?
If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite side of the
table;
If you meet some stranger in the streets, and love him or her--why I
often meet strangers in the street, and love them.

Why, what have you thought of yourself?
Is it you then that thought yourself less? 
Is it you that thought the President greater than you?
Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?
 
Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you were once drunk, or a
thief,
Or diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute--or are so now;
Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, and never
saw your name in print,
Do you give in that you are any less immortal?
 
Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,
untouchable and untouching;
It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you
are alive or no;
I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.
 
Grown, half-grown, and babe, of this country and every country, in-
doors and out-doors, one just as much as the other, I see, 
And all else behind or through them.
 
The wife--and she is not one jot less than the husband;
The daughter--and she is just as good as the son;
The mother--and she is every bit as much as the father.
 
Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,
Young fellows working on farms, and old fellows working on farms,
Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,
All these I see--but nigher and farther the same I see;
None shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape me.
 
I bring what you much need, yet always have, 
Not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good;
I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but
offer the value itself.
 
There is something that comes home to one now and perpetually;
It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed--it eludes discussion
and print;
It is not to be put in a book--it is not in this book;
It is for you, whoever you are--it is no farther from you than your
hearing and sight are from you;
It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest--it is ever provoked by
them.
 
You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it;
You may read the President's Message, and read nothing about it
there;
Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury
department, or in the daily papers or the weekly papers, 

Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts
of stock.
 
The sun and stars that float in the open air;
The apple-shaped earth, and we upon it--surely the drift of them is
something grand!
I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and that it is
happiness,
And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, or
bon-mot, or reconnoissance,
And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us,
and without luck must be a failure for us,
And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain
contingency.
 
The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the
greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things, the
endless pride and out-stretching of man, unspeakable joys and
sorrows,
The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders
that fill each minute of time forever,
What have you reckon'd them for, camerado? 
Have you reckon'd them for a trade, or farm-work? or for the profits
of a store?
Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure,
or a lady's leisure?
 
Have you reckon'd the landscape took substance and form that it might
be painted in a picture?
Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?
Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious
combinations, and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the
savans?
Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or
agriculture itself?
 
Old institutions--these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and
the practice handed along in manufactures--will we rate them so
high?
Will we rate our cash and business high?--I have no objection; 
I rate them as high as the highest--then a child born of a woman and
man I rate beyond all rate.
 
We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand;
I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are;
I am this day just as much in love with them as you;
Then I am in love with you, and with all my fellows upon the earth.
 
We consider bibles and religions divine--I do not say they are not

divine;
I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still;
It is not they who give the life--it is you who give the life;
Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,
than they are shed out of you.
 
When the psalm sings instead of the singer; 
When the script preaches instead of the preacher;
When the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the carver that carved
the supporting desk;
When I can touch the body of books, by night or by day, and when they
touch my body back again;
When a university course convinces, like a slumbering woman and child
convince;
When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's
daughter;
When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly
companions;
I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as I do of
men and women like you.
 
The sum of all known reverence I add up in you, whoever you are;
The President is there in the White House for you--it is not you who
are here for him;
The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you--not you here for
them; 
The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you;
Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the
going and coming of commerce and mails, are all for you.
 
List close, my scholars dear!
All doctrines, all politics and civilization, exurge from you;
All sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are
tallied in you;
The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records
reach, is in you this hour, and myths and tales the same;
If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?
The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays would be
vacuums.
 
All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;
(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of the
arches and cornices?) 
 
All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the
instruments;
It is not the violins and the cornets--it is not the oboe nor the
beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing
his sweet romanza--nor that of the men's chorus, nor that of
the women's chorus,
It is nearer and farther than they.

Will the whole come back then?
Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass? is
there nothing greater or more?
Does all sit there with you, with the mystic, unseen Soul?
 
Strange and hard that paradox true I give;
Objects gross and the unseen Soul are one.
 
House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;
Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin-roofing,
shingle-dressing, 
Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flagging of side-
walks by flaggers,
The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal-kiln and
brick-kiln,
Coal-mines, and all that is down there,--the lamps in the darkness,
echoes, songs, what meditations, what vast native thoughts
looking through smutch'd faces,
Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the river-banks--men
around feeling the melt with huge crowbars--lumps of ore, the
due combining of ore, limestone, coal--the blast-furnace and
the puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom of the melt

strong, clean-shaped T-rail for railroads;
Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house, steam-saws,
the great mills and factories;
Stone-cutting, shapely trimmings for façades, or window or door-
lintels--the mallet, the tooth-chisel, the jib to protect the
thumb,
Oakum, the oakum-chisel, the caulking-iron--the kettle of boiling
vault-cement, and the fire under the kettle,
The cotton-bale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck of the

butcher, the ice-saw, and all the work with ice,
The implements for daguerreotyping--the tools of the rigger,
grappler, sail-maker, block-maker,
Goods of gutta-percha, papier-maché, colors, brushes, brush-making,
glazier's implements, 
 
O you robust, sacred!
I cannot tell you how I love you;
All I love America for, is contained in men and women like you.
 
The veneer and glue-pot, the confectioner's ornaments, the decanter
and glasses, the shears and flat-iron,
The awl and knee-strap, the pint measure and quart measure, the
counter and stool, the writing-pen of quill or metal--the
making of all sorts of edged tools,
The brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, every thing that is done by
brewers, also by wine-makers, also vinegar-makers,

Leather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting,
distilling, sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking--
electro-plating, electrotyping, stereotyping,
Stave-machines, planing-machines, reaping-machines, ploughing-
machines, thrashing-machines, steam wagons,
The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous dray;
Pyrotechny, letting off color'd fire-works at night, fancy figures
and jets;
Beef on the butcher's stall, the slaughter-house of the butcher, the
butcher in his killing-clothes,
The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-hook, the
scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's
maul, and the plenteous winter-work of pork-packing;
Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice--the barrels and the
half and quarter barrels, the loaded barges, the high piles on
wharves and levees; 
The men, and the work of the men, on railroads, coasters, fish-boats,
canals;
The daily routine of your own or any man's life--the shop, yard,
store, or factory;
These shows all near you by day and night--workman! whoever you are,
your daily life!
In that and them the heft of the heaviest--in them far more than you
estimated, and far less also;
In them realities for you and me--in them poems for you and me;
In them, not yourself--you and your Soul enclose all things,
regardless of estimation;
In them the development good--in them, all themes and hints.
 
I do not affirm what you see beyond is futile--I do not advise you to
stop;
I do not say leadings you thought great are not great;
But I say that none lead to greater, than those lead to. 
 
Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at last,
In things best known to you, finding the best, or as good as the
best,
In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest, lovingest;
Happiness, knowledge, not in another place, but this place--not for
another hour, but this hour;
Man in the first you see or touch--always in friend, brother, nighest
neighbor--Woman in mother, lover, wife;
The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or any
where,
You workwomen and workmen of These States having your own divine and
strong life,
And all else giving place to men and women like you.

Grace Before Song
Ezra Pound
Lord God of heaven that with mercy dight
Th'alternate prayer wheel of the night and light
Eternal hath to thee, and in whose sight
Our days as rain drops in the sea surge fall,
 
As bright white drops upon a leaden sea
Grant so my songs to this grey folk may be:
 
As drops that dream and gleam and falling catch the sun
Evan'scent mirrors every opal one
Of such his splendor as their compass is,
So, bold My Songs, seek ye such death as this.

My Most Distinguished Guest And Learned Friend
Edna St. Vincent Millay
My most Distinguished Guest and Learned Friend,
The pallid hare that runs before the day
Having brought your earnest counsels to an end
Now have I somewhat of my own to say:
That it is folly to be sunk in love,
And madness plain to make the matter known,
There are no mysteries you are verger of;
Everyman's wisdoms these are, and my own.
If I have flung my heart unto a hound
I have done ill, it is a certain thing;
Yet breathe I freer, walk I the more sound
On my sick bones for this brave reasoning?
Soon must I say, "" 'Tis prowling Death I hear!""
Yet come no better off, for my quick ear.

Journey Of The Magi
Thomas Stearns Eliot
'A cold coming we had of it,
Just the worst time of the year
For a journey, and such a journey:
The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter.'
And the camels galled, sore-footed,
refractory,
Lying down in the melting snow.
There were times we regretted
The summer palaces on slopes, the
terraces,
And the silken girls bringing sherbet.
 
Then the camel men cursing and
grumbling
And running away, and wanting their
liquor and women,
And the night-fires going out, and the
lack of shelters,
And the cities hostile and the towns
unfriendly
And the villages dirty and charging high
prices:
A hard time we had of it.
At the end we preferred to travel all
night,
Sleeping in snatches,
With the voices singing in our ears,
saying
That this was all folly.
 
Then at dawn we came down to a
temperate valley,
Wet, below the snow line, smelling of
vegetation;
With a running stream and a water-mill
beating the darkness,
And three trees on the low sky,
And an old white horse galloped in
away in the meadow.
Then we came to a tavern with
vine-leaves over the lintel,
Six hands at an open door dicing for
pieces of silver,
And feet kicking the empty wine-skins.
But there was no imformation, and so
we continued
And arrived at evening, not a moment
too soon
Finding the place; it was (you may say)
satisfactory.

All this was a long time ago, I
remember,
And I would do it again, but set down
This set down
This: were we led all that way for
Birth or Death? There was a Birth,
certainly,
We had evidence and no doubt. I had
seen birth and death,
But had thought they were different;
this Birth was
Hard and bitter agony for us, like
Death, our death.
We returned to our places, these
Kingdoms,
But no longer at ease here, in the old
dispensation,
With an alien people clutching their
gods.
I should be glad of another death.

Song Of A Second April
Edna St. Vincent Millay
April this year, not otherwise
Than April of a year ago,
Is full of whispers, full of sighs,
Of dazzling mud and dingy snow;
Hepaticas that pleased you so
Are here again, and butterflies.
 
There rings a hammering all day,
And shingles lie about the doors;
In orchards near and far away
The grey wood-pecker taps and bores;
The men are merry at their chores,
And children earnest at their play.
 
The larger streams run still and deep,
Noisy and swift the small brooks run
Among the mullein stalks the sheep
Go up the hillside in the sun,
Pensively, -- only you are gone,
You that alone I cared to keep.

The Swarm
Sylvia Plath
Somebody is shooting at something in our town --
A dull pom, pom in the Sunday street.
Jealousy can open the blood,
It can make black roses.
Who are the shooting at?
 
It is you the knives are out for
At Waterloo, Waterloo, Napoleon,
The hump of Elba on your short back,
And the snow, marshaling its brilliant cutlery
Mass after mass, saying Shh!
 
Shh! These are chess people you play with,
Still figures of ivory.
The mud squirms with throats,
Stepping stones for French bootsoles.
The gilt and pink domes of Russia melt and float off
 
In the furnace of greed. Clouds, clouds.
So the swarm balls and deserts
Seventy feet up, in a black pine tree.
It must be shot down. Pom! Pom!
So dumb it thinks bullets are thunder.
 
It thinks they are the voice of God
Condoning the beak, the claw, the grin of the dog
Yellow-haunched, a pack-dog,
Grinning over its bone of ivory
Like the pack, the pack, like everybody.
 
The bees have got so far. Seventy feet high!
Russia, Poland and Germany!
The mild hills, the same old magenta
Fields shrunk to a penny
Spun into a river, the river crossed.
 
The bees argue, in their black ball,
A flying hedgehog, all prickles.
The man with gray hands stands under the honeycomb
Of their dream, the hived station
Where trains, faithful to their steel arcs,
 
Leave and arrive, and there is no end to the country.
Pom! Pom! They fall
Dismembered, to a tod of ivy.
So much for the charioteers, the outriders, the Grand Army!
A red tatter, Napoleon!
 
The last badge of victory.
The swarm is knocked into a cocked straw hat.
Elba, Elba, bleb on the sea!
The white busts of marshals, admirals, generals

Worming themselves into niches.
 
How instructive this is!
The dumb, banded bodies
Walking the plank draped with Mother France's upholstery
Into a new mausoleum,
An ivory palace, a crotch pine.
 
The man with gray hands smiles --
The smile of a man of business, intensely practical.
They are not hands at all
But asbestos receptacles.
Pom! Pom! 'They would have killed me.'
 
Stings big as drawing pins!
It seems bees have a notion of honor,
A black intractable mind.
Napoleon is pleased, he is pleased with everything.
O Europe! O ton of honey!

Adrift! A little boat adrift!
Emily Dickinson

 
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town?
 
So Sailors say--on yesterday--
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up its strife
And gurgled down and down.
 
So angels say--on yesterday--
Just as the dawn was red
One little boat--o'erspent with gales--
Retrimmed its masts--redecked its sails--
And shot--exultant on!

assurances
Walt Whitman
I NEED no assurances--I am a man who is preoccupied, of his own Soul;
I do not doubt that from under the feet, and beside the hands and
face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not
cognizant of--calm and actual faces;
I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in
any iota of the world;
I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless--
in vain I try to think how limitless;
I do not doubt that the orbs, and the systems of orbs, play their
swift sports through the air on purpose--and that I shall one
day be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they;
I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on, millions of
years;
I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have
their exteriors--and that the eye-sight has another eye-sight,
and the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice;
I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are
provided for--and that the deaths of young women, and the
deaths of little children, are provided for;
(Did you think Life was so well provided for--and Death, the purport
of all Life, is not well provided for?)
I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of
them--no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has
gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points; 
I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen, any where, at any
time, is provided for, in the inherences of things;
I do not think Life provides for all, and for Time and Space--but I
believe Heavenly Death provides for all.

He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,
business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.
But I will not hold the bridle
while he clinches the girth.
And he may mount by himself:
I will not give him a leg up.
 
Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,
I will not tell him which way the fox ran.
With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where
the black boy hides in the swamp.
I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;
I am not on his pay-roll.
 
I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends
nor of my enemies either.
Though he promise me much,
I will not map him the route to any man's door.

One Step Backward Taken
Robert Frost
Not only sands and gravels
Were once more on their travels,
But gulping muddy gallons
Great boulders off their balance
Bumped heads together dully
And started down the gully.
Whole capes caked off in slices.
I felt my standpoint shaken
In the universal crisis.
But with one step backward taken
I saved myself from going.
A world torn loose went by me.
Then the rain stopped and the blowing,
And the sun came out to dry me.

The Planet On The Table
Wallace Stevens
Ariel was glad he had written his poems.
They were of a remembered time
Or of something seen that he liked.
 
Other makings of the sun
Were waste and welter
And the ripe shrub writhed.
 
His self and the sun were one
And his poems, although makings of his self,
Were no less makings of the sun.
 
It was not important that they survive.
What mattered was that they should bear
Some lineament or character,
 
Some affluence, if only half-perceived,
In the poverty of their words,
Of the planet of which they were part.

Four Quartets 3: The Dry Salvages
Thomas Stearns Eliot
(The Dry Salvages -- presumably les trois sauvages -- is a small
group of rocks, with a beacon, off the N.E. coast of Cape Ann,
Massachusetts. Salvages is pronounced to rhyme with assuages.
Groaner: a whistling buoy.)
 
I
 
I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river
Is a strong brown god -- sullen, untamed and intractable,
Patient to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier;
Useful, untrustworthy, as a conveyor of commerce;
Then only a problem confronting the builder of bridges.
The problem once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten
By the dwellers in cities -- ever, however, implacable.
Keeping his seasons and rages, destroyer, reminder
Of what men choose to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated
By worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and waiting.
His rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom,
In the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard,
In the smell of grapes on the autumn table,
And the evening circle in the winter gaslight.
 
The river is within us, the sea is all about us;
The sea is the land's edge also, the granite
Into which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses
Its hints of earlier and other creation:
The starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's backbone;
The pools where it offers to our curiosity
The more delicate algae and the sea anemone.
It tosses up our losses, the torn seine,
The shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar
And the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many voices,
Many gods and many voices.
The salt is on the briar rose,
The fog is in the fir trees.
The sea howl
And the sea yelp, are different voices
Often together heard: the whine in the rigging,
The menace and caress of wave that breaks on water,
The distant rote in the granite teeth,
And the wailing warning from the approaching headland
Are all sea voices, and the heaving groaner
Rounded homewards, and the seagull:
And under the oppression of the silent fog
The tolling bell
Measures time not our time, rung by the unhurried
Ground swell, a time
Older than the time of chronometers, older
Than time counted by anxious worried women
Lying awake, calculating the future,
Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel

And piece together the past and the future,
Between midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception,
The future futureless, before the morning watch
When time stops and time is never ending;
And the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning,
Clangs
The bell.
 
II
 
Where is there an end of it, the soundless wailing,
The silent withering of autumn flowers
Dropping their petals and remaining motionless;
Where is there and end to the drifting wreckage,
The prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable
Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?
 
There is no end, but addition: the trailing
Consequence of further days and hours,
While emotion takes to itself the emotionless
Years of living among the breakage
Of what was believed in as the most reliable -- 
And therefore the fittest for renunciation.
 
There is the final addition, the failing
Pride or resentment at failing powers,
The unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless,
In a drifting boat with a slow leakage,
The silent listening to the undeniable
Clamour of the bell of the last annunciation.
 
Where is the end of them, the fishermen sailing
Into the wind's tail, where the fog cowers?
We cannot think of a time that is oceanless
Or of an ocean not littered with wastage
Or of a future that is not liable
Like the past, to have no destination.
 
We have to think of them as forever bailing,
Setting and hauling, while the North East lowers
Over shallow banks unchanging and erosionless
Or drawing their money, drying sails at dockage;
Not as making a trip that will be unpayable
For a haul that will not bear examination.
 
There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,
No end to the withering of withered flowers,
To the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,
To the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,
The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely prayable
Prayer of the one Annunciation.

It seems, as one becomes older,
That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence -- 
Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy
Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution,
Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning the past.
The moments of happiness -- not the sense of well-being,
Fruition, fulfilment, security or affection,
Or even a very good dinner, but the sudden illumination -- 
We had the experience but missed the meaning,
And approach to the meaning restores the experience
In a different form, beyond any meaning
We can assign to happiness. I have said before
That the past experience revived in the meaning
Is not the experience of one life only
But of many generations -- not forgetting
Something that is probably quite ineffable:
The backward look behind the assurance
Of recorded history, the backward half-look
Over the shoulder, towards the primitive terror.
Now, we come to discover that the moments of agony
(Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding,
Having hoped for the wrong things or dreaded the wrong things,
Is not in question) are likewise permanent
With such permanence as time has. We appreciate this better
In the agony of others, nearly experienced,
Involving ourselves, than in our own.
For our own past is covered by the currents of action,
But the torment of others remains an experience
Unqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition.
People change, and smile: but the agony abides.
Time the destroyer is time the preserver,
Like the river with its cargo of dead negroes, cows and chicken coops,
The bitter apple, and the bite in the apple.
And the ragged rock in the restless waters,
Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;
On a halcyon day it is merely a monument,
In navigable weather it is always a seamark
To lay a course by: but in the sombre season
Or the sudden fury, is what it always was.

I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant -- 
Among other things -- or one way of putting the same thing:
That the future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray
Of wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,
Pressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been opened.
And the way up is the way down, the way forward is the way back.
You cannot face it steadily, but this thing is sure,
That time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.

When the train starts, and the passengers are settled
To fruit, periodicals and business letters
(And those who saw them off have left the platform)
Their faces relax from grief into relief,
To the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.
Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past
Into different lives, or into any future;
You are not the same people who left that station
Or who will arrive at any terminus,
While the narrowing rails slide together behind you;
And on the deck of the drumming liner
Watching the furrow that widens behind you,
You shall not think 'the past is finished'
Or 'the future is before us'.
At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,
Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,
The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)
'Fare forward, you who think that you are voyaging;
You are not those who saw the harbour
Receding, or those who will disembark.
Here between the hither and the farther shore
While time is withdrawn, consider the future
And the past with an equal mind.
At the moment which is not of action or inaction
You can receive this: ""on whatever sphere of being
The mind of a man may be intent
At the time of death"" -- that is the one action
(And the time of death is every moment)
Which shall fructify in the lives of others:
And do not think of the fruit of action.
Fare forward.
O voyagers, O seamen,
You who came to port, and you whose bodies
Will suffer the trial and judgement of the sea,
Or whatever event, this is your real destination.'
So Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna
On the field of battle.
Not fare well,
But fare forward, voyagers.

Lady, whose shrine stands on the promontory,
Pray for all those who are in ships, those
Whose business has to do with fish, and
Those concerned with every lawful traffic
And those who conduct them.
 
Repeat a prayer also on behalf of
Women who have seen their sons or husbands
Setting forth, and not returning:

Figlia del tuo figlio,
Queen of Heaven.
 
Also pray for those who were in ships, and
Ended their voyage on the sand, in the sea's lips
Or in the dark throat which will not reject them
Or wherever cannot reach them the sound of the sea bell's
Perpetual angelus.

To communicate with Mars, converse with spirits,
To report the behaviour of the sea monster,
Describe the horoscope, haruspicate or scry,
Observe disease in signatures, evoke
Biography from the wrinkles of the palm
And tragedy from fingers; release omens
By sortilege, or tea leaves, riddle the inevitable
With playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams
Or barbituric acids, or dissect
The recurrent image into pre-conscious terrors -- 
To explore the womb, or tomb, or dreams; all these are usual
Pastimes and drugs, and features of the press:
And always will be, some of them especially
When there is distress of nations and perplexity
Whether on the shores of Asia, or in the Edgware Road.
Men's curiosity searches past and future
And clings to that dimension. But to apprehend
The point of intersection of the timeless
With time, is an occupation for the saint -- 
No occupation either, but something given
And taken, in a lifetime's death in love,
Ardour and selflessness and self-surrender.
For most of us, there is only the unattended
Moment, the moment in and out of time,
The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,
The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning
Or the waterfall, or music heard so deeply
That it is not heard at all, but you are the music
While the music lasts. These are only hints and guesses,
Hints followed by guesses; and the rest
Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.
The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation.
Here the impossible union
Of spheres of existence is actual,
Here the past and future
Are conquered, and reconciled,
Where action were otherwise movement
Of that which is only moved
And has in it no source of movement -- 
Driven by d&aelig;monic, chthonic

Powers. And right action is freedom
From past and future also.
For most of us, this is the aim
Never here to be realised;
Who are only undefeated
Because we have gone on trying;
We, content at the last
If our temporal reversion nourish
(Not too far from the yew-tree)
The life of significant soil.

The Exorcists
Anne Sexton
And I solemnly swear
on the chill of secrecy
that I know you not, this room never,
the swollen dress I wear,
nor the anonymous spoons that free me,
nor this calendar nor the pulse we pare and cover.
 
For all these present,
before that wandering ghost,
that yellow moth of my summer bed,
I say: this small event
is not. So I prepare, am dosed
in ether and will not cry what stays unsaid.
 
I was brown with August,
the clapping waves at my thighs
and a storm riding into the cove. We swam
while the others beached and burst
for their boarded huts, their hale cries
shouting back to us and the hollow slam
of the dory against the float.
Black arms of thunder strapped
upon us, squalled out, we breathed in rain
and stroked past the boat.
We thrashed for shore as if we were trapped
in green and that suddenly inadequate stain
 
of lightning belling around
our skin. Bodies in air
we raced for the empty lobsterman-shack.
It was yellow inside, the sound
of the underwing of the sun. I swear,
I most solemnly swear, on all the bric-a-brac
 
of summer loves, I know
you not.

Vanity Fair
Sylvia Plath
Through frost-thick weather
This witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if
Caught in a hazardous medium that might
Merely by its continuing
Attach her to heaven.
 
At eye's envious corner
Crow's-feet copy veining on a stained leaf;
Cold squint steals sky's color; while bruit
Of bells calls holy ones, her tongue
Backtalks at the raven
 
Claeving furred air
Over her skull's midden; no knife
Rivals her whetted look, divining what conceit
Waylays simple girls, church-going,
And what heart's oven
 
Craves most to cook batter
Rich in strayings with every amorous oaf,
Ready, for a trinket,
To squander owl-hours on bracken bedding,
Flesh unshriven.
 
Against virgin prayer
This sorceress sets mirrors enough
To distract beauty's thought;
Lovesick at first fond song,
Each vain girl's driven
 
To believe beyond heart's flare
No fire is, nor in any book proof
Sun hoists soul up after lids fall shut;
So she wills all to the black king.
The worst sloven
 
Vies with best queen over
Right to blaze as satan's wife;
Housed in earth, those million brides shriek out.
Some burn short, some long,
Staked in pride's coven.
 
Anonymous submission.

The Night Dances
Sylvia Plath
A smile fell in the grass.
Irretrievable!
 
And how will your night dances
Lose themselves. In mathematics?
 
Such pure leaps and spirals ----
Surely they travel
 
The world forever, I shall not entirely
Sit emptied of beauties, the gift
 
Of your small breath, the drenched grass
Smell of your sleeps, lilies, lilies.
 
Their flesh bears no relation.
Cold folds of ego, the calla,
 
And the tiger, embellishing itself ----
Spots, and a spread of hot petals.
 
The comets
Have such a space to cross,
 
Such coldness, forgetfulness.
So your gestures flake off ----
 
Warm and human, then their pink light
Bleeding and peeling
 
Through the black amnesias of heaven.
Why am I given
 
These lamps, these planets
Falling like blessings, like flakes
 
Six sided, white
On my eyes, my lips, my hair
 
Touching and melting.
Nowhere.

Songs for a Colored Singer
Elizabeth Bishop
I
 
A washing hangs upon the line,
but it's not mine.
None of the things that I can see
belong to me.
The neighbors got a radio with an aerial;
we got a little portable.
They got a lot of closet space;
we got a suitcase.
 
I say, ""Le Roy, just how much are we owing?
Something I can't comprehend,
the more we got the more we spend....""
He only answers, ""Let's get going.""
Le Roy, you're earning too much money now.
 
I sit and look at our backyard
and find it very hard.
What have we got for all his dollars and cents?
--A pile of bottles by the fence.
He's faithful and he's kind
but he sure has an inquiring mind.
He's seen a lot; he's bound to see the rest,
and if I protest
 
Le Roy answers with a frown,
""Darling, when I earns I spends.
The world is wide; it still extends....
I'm going to get a job in the next town.""
Le Roy, you're earning too much money now.

The time has come to call a halt;
and so it ends.
He's gone off with his other friends.
He needn't try to make amends,
this occasion's all his fault.
Through rain and dark I see his face
across the street at Flossie's place.
He's drinking in the warm pink glow
to th' accompaniment of the piccolo.
 
The time has come to call a halt.
I met him walking with Varella
and hit him twice with my umbrella.
Perhaps that occasion was my fault,
but the time has come to call a halt.
 
Go drink your wine and go get tight.
Let the piccolo play.

I'm sick of all your fussing anyway.
Now I'm pursuing my own way.
I'm leaving on the bus tonight.
Far down the highway wet and black
I'll ride and ride and not come back.
I'm going to go and take the bus
and find someone monogamous.
 
The time has come to call a halt.
I've borrowed fifteen dollars fare
and it will take me anywhere.
For this occasion's all his fault.
The time has come to call a halt.

What's that shining in the leaves,
the shadowy leaves,
like tears when somebody grieves,
shining, shining in the leaves?

Is it dew or is it tears,
dew or tears,
hanging there for years and years
like a heavy dew of tears?
 
Then that dew begins to fall,
roll down and fall,
Maybe it's not tears at all.
See it, see it roll and fall.
 
Hear it falling on the ground,
hear, all around.
That is not a tearful sound,
beating, beating on the ground.
 
See it lying there like seeds,
like black seeds.
see it taking root like weeds,
faster, faster than the weeds,
 
all the shining seeds take root,
conspiring root,
and what curious flower or fruit
will grow from that conspiring root?
 
fruit or flower? It is a face.
Yes, a face.
In that dark and dreary place
each seed grows into a face.
 
Like an army in a dream
the faces seem,
darker, darker, like a dream.
They're too real to be a dream.

The Thin People
Sylvia Plath
They are always with us, the thin people
Meager of dimension as the gray people
 
On a movie-screen. They
Are unreal, we say:
 
It was only in a movie, it was only
In a war making evil headlines when we
 
Were small that they famished and
Grew so lean and would not round
 
Out their stalky limbs again though peace
Plumped the bellies of the mice
 
Under the meanest table.
It was during the long hunger-battle
 
They found their talent to persevere
In thinness, to come, later,
 
Into our bad dreams, their menace
Not guns, not abuses,
 
But a thin silence.
Wrapped in flea-ridded donkey skins,
 
Empty of complaint, forever
Drinking vinegar from tin cups: they wore
 
The insufferable nimbus of the lot-drawn
Scapegoat. But so thin,
 
So weedy a race could not remain in dreams,
Could not remain outlandish victims
 
In the contracted country of the head
Any more than the old woman in her mud hut could
 
Keep from cutting fat meat
Out of the side of the generous moon when it
 
Set foot nightly in her yard
Until her knife had pared
 
The moon to a rind of little light.
Now the thin people do not obliterate
 
Themselves as the dawn
Grayness blues, reddens, and the outline
 
Of the world comes clear and fills with color.

They persist in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
 
Frieze of cabbage-roses and cornflowers pales
Under their thin-lipped smiles,
 
Their withering kingship.
How they prop each other up!
 
We own no wilderness rich and deep enough
For stronghold against their stiff
 
Battalions. See, how the tree boles flatten
And lose their good browns
 
If the thin people simply stand in the forest,
Making the world go thin as a wasp's nest
 
And grayer; not even moving their bones.

Questions of Travel
Elizabeth Bishop
There are too many waterfalls here; the crowded streams
hurry too rapidly down to the sea,
and the pressure of so many clouds on the mountaintops
makes them spill over the sides in soft slow-motion,
turning to waterfalls under our very eyes.
--For if those streaks, those mile-long, shiny, tearstains,
aren't waterfalls yet,
in a quick age or so, as ages go here,
they probably will be.
But if the streams and clouds keep travelling, travelling,
the mountains look like the hulls of capsized ships,
slime-hung and barnacled.
 
Think of the long trip home.
Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?
Where should we be today?
Is it right to be watching strangers in a play
in this strangest of theatres?
What childishness is it that while there's a breath of life
in our bodies, we are determined to rush
to see the sun the other way around?
The tiniest green hummingbird in the world?
To stare at some inexplicable old stonework,
inexplicable and impenetrable,
at any view,
instantly seen and always, always delightful?
Oh, must we dream our dreams
and have them, too?
And have we room
for one more folded sunset, still quite warm?
 
But surely it would have been a pity
not to have seen the trees along this road,
really exaggerated in their beauty,
not to have seen them gesturing
like noble pantomimists, robed in pink.
--Not to have had to stop for gas and heard
the sad, two-noted, wooden tune
of disparate wooden clogs
carelessly clacking over
a grease-stained filling-station floor.
(In another country the clogs would all be tested.
Each pair there would have identical pitch.)
--A pity not to have heard
the other, less primitive music of the fat brown bird
who sings above the broken gasoline pump
in a bamboo church of Jesuit baroque:
three towers, five silver crosses.
--Yes, a pity not to have pondered,
blurr'dly and inconclusively,
on what connection can exist for centuries
between the crudest wooden footwear

and, careful and finicky,
the whittled fantasies of wooden footwear
and, careful and finicky,
the whittled fantasies of wooden cages.
--Never to have studied history in
the weak calligraphy of songbirds' cages.
--And never to have had to listen to rain
so much like politicians' speeches:
two hours of unrelenting oratory
and then a sudden golden silence
in which the traveller takes a notebook, writes:
 
""Is it lack of imagination that makes us come
to imagined places, not just stay at home?
Or could Pascal have been not entirely right
about just sitting quietly in one's room?
 
Continent, city, country, society:
the choice is never wide and never free.
And here, or there . . . No. Should we have stayed at home,
wherever that may be?""

Two Figures in Dense Violet Light
Wallace Stevens
I had as lief be embraced by the portier of the hotel
As to get no more from the moonlight
Than your moist hand.
 
Be the voice of the night and Florida in my ear.
Use dasky words and dusky images.
Darken your speech.
 
Speak, even, as if I did not hear you speaking,
But spoke for you perfectly in my thoughts,
Conceiving words,
 
As the night conceives the sea-sound in silence,
And out of the droning sibilants makes
A serenade.
 
Say, puerile, that the buzzards crouch on the ridge-pole
and sleep with one eye watching the stars fall
Beyond Key West.
 
Say that the palms are clear in the total blue.
Are clear and are obscure; that it is night;
That the moon shines.

The Suicide
Edna St. Vincent Millay
""Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!
Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!
And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,
I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly
That I might eat again, and met thy sneers
With deprecations, and thy blows with tears, -- 
Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,
As if spent passion were a holiday!
And now I go. Nor threat, nor easy vow
Of tardy kindness can avail thee now
With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;
Lonely I came, and I depart alone,
And know not where nor unto whom I go;
But that thou canst not follow me I know.""
 
Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain
My thought ran still, until I spake again:
 
""Ah, but I go not as I came, -- no trace
Is mine to bear away of that old grace
I brought! I have been heated in thy fires,
Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,
Thy mark is on me! I am not the same
Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.
Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.
In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed
Is wakeful for alarm, -- oh, shame to thee,
For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,
Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing
Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing
To have about the house when I was grown
If thou hadst left my little joys alone!
I asked of thee no favor save this one:
That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!
And this thou didst deny, calling my name
Insistently, until I rose and came.
I saw the sun no more. -- It were not well
So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,
Need I arise to-morrow and renew
Again my hated tasks, but I am through
With all things save my thoughts and this one night,
So that in truth I seem already quite
Free,and remote from thee, -- I feel no haste
And no reluctance to depart; I taste
Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,
That in a little while I shall have quaffed.""
 
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,
Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed
Before me one by one till once again
I set new words unto an old refrain:

""Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!
Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine
Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown
Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!
And I have waited well for thee to show
If any share were mine, -- and now I go
Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain
I shall but come into mine own again!""
 
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,
But turning, straightway, sought a certain door
In the rear wall. Heavy it was, and low
And dark, -- a way by which none e'er would go
That other exit had, and never knock
Was heard thereat, -- bearing a curious lock
Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,
Whereof Life held content the useless key,
And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,
Whose sudden voice across a silence must,
I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear, -- 
A strange door, ugly like a dwarf. -- So near
I came I felt upon my feet the chill
Of acid wind creeping across the sill.
So stood longtime, till over me at last
Came weariness, and all things other passed
To make it room; the still night drifted deep
Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.
 
But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,
Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!
Startled, I raised my head, -- and with a shout
Laid hold upon the latch, -- and was without.
 
* * * *
 
Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,
Leading me back unto my old abode,
My father's house! There in the night I came,
And found them feasting, and all things the same
As they had been before. A splendour hung
Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung
As, echoing out of very long ago,
Had called me from the house of Life, I know.
So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame
On the unlovely garb in which I came;
Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:
""It is my father's house!"" I said and knocked;
And the door opened. To the shining crowd
Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,
Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,
And ""Father!"" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.

* * * *
 
Ah, days of joy that followed! All alone
I wandered through the house. My own, my own,
My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,
All I had lacked so long and loved so well!
None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,
Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.
 
I know not when the wonder came to me
Of what my father's business might be,
And whither fared and on what errands bent
The tall and gracious messengers he sent.
Yet one day with no song from dawn till night
Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.
And the next day I called; and on the third
Asked them if I might go, -- but no one heard.
Then, sick with longing, I arose at last
And went unto my father, -- in that vast
Chamber wherein he for so many years
Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.
""Father,"" I said, ""Father, I cannot play
The harp that thou didst give me, and all day
I sit in idleness, while to and fro
About me thy serene, grave servants go;
And I am weary of my lonely ease.
Better a perilous journey overseas
Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,
To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed
That grows to naught, -- I love thee more than they
Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.
Father, I beg of thee a little task
To dignify my days, -- 'tis all I ask
Forever, but forever, this denied,
I perish.""
""Child,"" my father's voice replied,
""All things thy fancy hath desired of me
Thou hast received. I have prepared for thee
Within my house a spacious chamber, where
Are delicate things to handle and to wear,
And all these things are thine. Dost thou love song?
My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.
Or sigh for flowers? My fairest gardens stand
Open as fields to thee on every hand.
And all thy days this word shall hold the same:
No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.
But as for tasks -- "" he smiled, and shook his head;
""Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by,"" he said.

Ten fishermen waiting--they discover a thick school of mossbonkers--
they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,
The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course to the
beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,
The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,
Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand ankle-deep
in the water, pois'd on strong legs,
The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,
Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from the water,

Yes but don't do it by yourself, better consult your mother
to get the Correct Line of Thought, if not consult Rimbaud once he got his leg cut off
or Lenin after his second stroke sending a message thru Mrs Krupskaya
to the rude Georgian, & just before his deathly fit when the Cheka aides
outside
his door looked in coldly assuring him his affairs were in good hands no need to
move -
What sickness at the
pit of his stomach moved up to
his brain?
What thought Khlebnikov on the hungry train exposing his stomach to the

Or Mayakovsky before the bullet hit his brain, what sharp propaganda for

Sylvia's Death
Anne Sexton
<i>for Sylvia Plath </I>
 
O Sylvia, Sylvia,
with a dead box of stones and spoons,
with two children, two meteors
wandering loose in a tiny playroom,
with your mouth into the sheet,
into the roofbeam, into the dumb prayer,
(Sylvia, Sylvia
where did you go
after you wrote me
from Devonshire
about raising potatoes
and keeping bees?)
what did you stand by,
just how did you lie down into?
Thief --
how did you crawl into,
crawl down alone
into the death I wanted so badly and for so long,
the death we said we both outgrew,
the one we wore on our skinny breasts,
the one we talked of so often each time
we downed three extra dry martinis in Boston,
the death that talked of analysts and cures,
the death that talked like brides with plots,
the death we drank to,
the motives and the quiet deed?
(In Boston
the dying
ride in cabs,
yes death again,
that ride home
with our boy.)
O Sylvia, I remember the sleepy drummer
who beat on our eyes with an old story,
how we wanted to let him come
like a sadist or a New York fairy
to do his job,
a necessity, a window in a wall or a crib,
and since that time he waited
under our heart, our cupboard,
and I see now that we store him up
year after year, old suicides
and I know at the news of your death
a terrible taste for it, like salt,
(And me,
me too.
And now, Sylvia,
you again
with death again,
that ride home

with our boy.)
And I say only
with my arms stretched out into that stone place,
what is your death
but an old belonging,
a mole that fell out
of one of your poems?

A Pact
Ezra Pound
I make a pact with you, Walt Whitman -
I have detested you long enough.
I come to you as a grown child
Who has had a pig-headed father;
I am old enough now to make friends.
It was you that broke the new wood,
Now is a time for carving.
We have one sap and one root -
Let there be commerce between us.

Unknown Girl In A Maternity Ward
Anne Sexton
Child, the current of your breath is six days long.
You lie, a small knuckle on my white bed;
lie, fisted like a snail, so small and strong
at my breast. Your lips are animals; you are fed
with love. At first hunger is not wrong.
The nurses nod their caps; you are shepherded
down starch halls with the other unnested throng
in wheeling baskets. You tip like a cup; your head
moving to my touch. You sense the way we belong.
But this is an institution bed.
You will not know me very long.
 
The doctors are enamel. They want to know
the facts. They guess about the man who left me,
some pendulum soul, going the way men go
and leave you full of child. But our case history
stays blank. All I did was let you grow.
Now we are here for all the ward to see.
They thought I was strange, although
I never spoke a word. I burst empty of you,
letting you see how the air is so.
The doctors chart the riddle they ask of me
and I turn my head away. I do not know.
 
Yours is the only face I recognize.
Bone at my bone, you drink my answers in.
Six times a day I prize
your need, the animals of your lips, your skin
growing warm and plump. I see your eyes
lifting their tents. They are blue stones, they begin
to outgrow their moss. You blink in surprise
and I wonder what you can see, my funny kin,
as you trouble my silence. I am a shelter of lies.
Should I learn to speak again, or hopeless in
such sanity will I touch some face I recognize?
 
Down the hall the baskets start back. My arms
fit you like a sleeve, they hold
catkins of your willows, the wild bee farms
of your nerves, each muscle and fold
of your first days. Your old man's face disarms
the nurses. But the doctors return to scold
me. I speak. It is you my silence harms.
I should have known; I should have told
them something to write down. My voice alarms
my throat. ""Name of father -- none."" I hold
you and name you bastard in my arms.
 
And now that's that. There is nothing more
that I can say or lose.
Others have traded life before
and could not speak. I tighten to refuse

your owling eyes, my fragile visitor.
I touch your cheeks, like flowers. You bruise
against me. We unlearn. I am a shore
rocking off you. You break from me. I choose
your only way, my small inheritor
and hand you off, trembling the selves we lose.
Go child, who is my sin and nothing more.

Saints
Louise Gluck
In our family, there were two saints,
my aunt and my grandmother.
But their lives were different.
 
My grandmother's was tranquil, even at the end.
She was like a person walking in calm water;
for some reason
the sea couldn't bring itself to hurt her.
When my aunt took the same path,
the waves broke over her, they attacked her,
which is how the Fates respond
to a true spiritual nature.
 
My grandmother was cautious, conservative:
that's why she escaped suffering.
My aunt's escaped nothing;
each time the sea retreats, someone she loves is taken away.
 
Still she won't experience
the sea as evil. To her, it is what it is:
where it touches land, it must turn to violence.

Sleepers
Sylvia Plath
No map traces the street
Where those two sleepers are.
We have lost track of it.
They lie as if under water
In a blue, unchanging light,
The French window ajar
 
Curtained with yellow lace.
Through the narrow crack
Odors of wet earth rise.
The snail leaves a silver track;
Dark thickets hedge the house.
We take a backward look.
 
Among petals pale as death
And leaves steadfast in shape
They sleep on, mouth to mouth.
A white mist is going up.
The small green nostrils breathe,
And they turn in their sleep.
 
Ousted from that warm bed
We are a dream they dream.
Their eyelids keep up the shade.
No harm can come to them.
We cast our skins and slide
Into another time.

Romance Moderne
William Carlos Williams
Tracks of rain and light linger in
the spongy greens of a nature whose
flickering mountain--bulging nearer,
ebbing back into the sun
hollowing itself away to hold a lake,--
or brown stream rising and falling at the roadside, turning about,
churning itself white, drawing
green in over it,--plunging glassy funnels
fall--
 
And--the other world--
the windshield a blunt barrier:
Talk to me. Sh! they would hear us.
--the backs of their heads facing us--
The stream continues its motion of
a hound running over rough ground.
 
Trees vanish--reappear--vanish:
detached dance of gnomes--as a talk
dodging remarks, glows and fades.
--The unseen power of words--
And now that a few of the moves
are clear the first desire is
to fling oneself out at the side into
the other dance, to other music.
 
Peer Gynt. Rip Van Winkle. Diana.
If I were young I would try a new alignment--
alight nimbly from the car, Good-bye!--
Childhood companions linked two and two
criss-cross: four, three, two, one.
Back into self, tentacles withdrawn.
Feel about in warm self-flesh.
Since childhood, since childhood!
Childhood is a toad in the garden, a
happy toad. All toads are happy
and belong in gardens. A toad to Diana!
 
Lean forward. Punch the steerman
behind the ear. Twirl the wheel!
Over the edge! Screams! Crash!
The end. I sit above my head--
a little removed--or
a thin wash of rain on the roadway
--I am never afraid when he is driving,--
interposes new direction,
rides us sidewise, unforseen
into the ditch! All threads cut!
Death! Black. The end. The very end--
 
I would sit separate weighing a
small red handful: the dirt of these parts,

sliding mists sheeting the alders
against the touch of fingers creeping
to mine. All stuff of the blind emotions.
But--stirred, the eye seizes
for the first time--The eye awake!--
anything, a dirt bank with green stars
of scrawny weed flattened upon it under
a weight of air--For the first time!--
or a yawning depth: Big!
Swim around in it, through it--
all directions and find
vitreous seawater stuff--
God how I love you!--or, as I say,
a plunge into the ditch. The End. I sit
examining my red handful. Balancing
--this--in and out--agh.
 
Love you? It's
a fire in the blood, willy-nilly!
It's the sun coming up in the morning.
Ha, but it's the grey moon too, already up
in the morning. You are slow.
Men are not friends where it concerns
a woman? Fighters. Playfellows.
White round thighs! Youth! Sighs--!
It's the fillip of novelty. It's--
 
Mountains. Elephants humping along
against the sky--indifferent to
light withdrawing its tattered shreds,
worn out with embraces. It's
the fillip of novelty. It's a fire in the blood.
 
Oh get a flannel shirt, white flannel
or pongee. You'd look so well!
I married you because I liked your nose.
I wanted you! I wanted you
in spite of all they'd say--
 
Rain and light, mountain and rain,
rain and river. Will you love me always?
--A car overturned and two crushed bodies
under it.--Always! Always!
And the white moon already up.
White. Clean. All the colors.
A good head, backed by the eye--awake!
backed by the emotions--blind--
River and mountain, light and rain--or
rain, rock, light, trees--divided:
rain-light counter rocks-trees or
trees counter rain-light-rocks or--

Myriads of counter processions
crossing and recrossing, regaining
the advantage, buying here, selling there
--You are sold cheap everywhere in town!--
lingering, touching fingers, withdrawing
gathering forces into blares, hummocks,
peaks and rivers--rivers meeting rock
--I wish that you were lying there dead
and I sitting here beside you.--
It's the grey moon--over and over.
It's the clay of these parts.

Mist In The Valley

These hills, to hurt me more,
That am hurt already enough, -- 
Having left the sea behind,
Having turned suddenly and left the shore
That I had loved beyond all words, even a song's words, to
convey,
 
And built me a house on upland acres,
Sweet with the pinxter, bright and rough
With the rusty blackbird long before the winter's done,
But smelling never of bayberry hot in the sun,
Nor ever loud with the pounding of the long white breakers, -- 
 
These hills, beneath the October moon,
Sit in the valley white with mist
Like islands in a quiet bay,
 
Jut out from shore into the mist,
Wooded with poplar dark as pine,
Like points of land into a quiet bay.
 
(Just in the way
The harbour met the bay)
 
Stricken too sore for tears,
I stand, remembering the Islands and the sea's lost sound -- 
Life at its best no longer than the sand-peep's cry,
And I two years, two years,
Tilling an upland ground!

Dreaming The Breasts
Anne Sexton
Mother,
strange goddess face
above my milk home,
that delicate asylum,
I ate you up.
All my need took
you down like a meal.
 
What you gave
I remember in a dream:
the freckled arms binding me,
the laugh somewhere over my woolly hat,
the blood fingers tying my shoe,
the breasts hanging like two bats
and then darting at me,
bending me down.
 
The breasts I knew at midnight
beat like the sea in me now.
Mother, I put bees in my mouth
to keep from eating
yet it did no good.
In the end they cut off your breasts
and milk poured from them
into the surgeon's hand
and he embraced them.
I took them from him
and planted them.
 
I have put a padlock
on you, Mother, dear dead human,
so that your great bells,
those dear white ponies,
can go galloping, galloping,
wherever you are.

And arbitrary blackness gallops in:
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
 
I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)
 
God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:
Exit seraphim and Satan's men:
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
 
I fancied you'd return the way you said,
But I grow old and I forget your name.
(I think I made you up inside my head.)

At least when spring comes they roar back again.
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

This is winter, this is night, small love --
A sort of black horsehair,
A rough, dumb country stuff
Steeled with the sheen
Of what green stars can make it to our gate.
I hold you on my arm.
It is very late.
The dull bells tongue the hour.
The mirror floats us at one candle power.
 
This is the fluid in which we meet each other,
This haloey radiance that seems to breathe
And lets our shadows wither
Only to blow
Them huge again, violent giants on the wall.
One match scratch makes you real.
 
At first the candle will not bloom at all --
It snuffs its bud
To almost nothing, to a dull blue dud.
 
I hold my breath until you creak to life,
Balled hedgehog,
Small and cross. The yellow knife
Grows tall. You clutch your bars.
My singing makes you roar.
I rock you like a boat
Across the Indian carpet, the cold floor,
While the brass man
Kneels, back bent, as best he can
 
Hefting his white pillar with the light
That keeps the sky at bay,
The sack of black! It is everywhere, tight, tight!
He is yours, the little brassy Atlas --
Poor heirloom, all you have,
At his heels a pile of five brass cannonballs,
No child, no wife.
Five balls! Five bright brass balls!
To juggle with, my love, when the sky falls.

But ah! -- to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!
Would that it were day again! -- with twilight near!
 
Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;
This or that or what you will is all the same to me;
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, -- 
There's little use in anything as far as I can see.
 
Love has gone and left me, -- and the neighbors knock and
borrow,
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, -- 
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
There's this little street and this little house.

my sweater,
up into a ball,
and took it
to bed with me,
a kind of stand-in

bricks of gold.

And the trees about me,
Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks
Groan with continual surges; and behind me
Make all a desolation. Look, look, wenches!
 
Paint me a cavernous waste shore
Cast in the unstilted Cyclades,
Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks
Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.
 
Display me Aeolus above
Reviewing the insurgent gales
Which tangle Ariadne's hair
And swell with haste the perjured sails.
 
Morning stirs the feet and hands
(Nausicaa and Polypheme),
Gesture of orang-outang
Rises from the sheets in steam.
 
This withered root of knots of hair
Slitted below and gashed with eyes,
This oval O cropped out with teeth:
The sickle motion from the thighs
 
Jackknifes upward at the knees
Then straightens out from heel to hip
Pushing the framework of the bed
And clawing at the pillow slip.
 
Sweeney addressed full length to shave
Broadbottomed, pink from nape to base,
Knows the female temperament
And wipes the suds around his face.
 
(The lengthened shadow of a man
Is history, said Emerson
Who had not seen the silhouette
Of Sweeney straddled in the sun).
 
Tests the razor on his leg
Waiting until the shriek subsides.
The epileptic on the bed
Curves backward, clutching at her sides.
 
The ladies of the corridor
Find themselves involved, disgraced,
Call witness to their principles
And deprecate the lack of taste
 
Observing that hysteria

Might easily be misunderstood;

It does the house no sort of good.

Enters padding on broad feet,
Bringing sal volatile

Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine

Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!
 
Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,
Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower--
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum--
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

Mungojerrie And Rumpelteazer
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer were a very notorious couple
of cats.
As knockabout clown, quick-change comedians, tight-rope
walkers and acrobats
They had extensive reputation. They made their home in
Victoria Grove--
That was merely their centre of operation, for they were
incurably given to rove.
They were very well know in Cornwall Gardens, in Launceston
Place and in Kensington Square--
They had really a little more reputation than a couple of
cats can very well bear.
 
If the area window was found ajar
And the basement looked like a field of war,
If a tile or two came loose on the roof,
Which presently ceased to be waterproof,
If the drawers were pulled out from the bedroom chests,
And you couldn't find one of your winter vests,
Or after supper one of the girls
Suddenly missed her Woolworth pearls:
 
Then the family would say: ""It's that horrible cat!
It was Mungojerrie--or Rumpelteazer!""-- And most of the time
they left it at that.
 
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer had a very unusual gift of the
gab.
They were highly efficient cat-burglars as well, and
remarkably smart at smash-and-grab.
They made their home in Victoria Grove. They had no regular
occupation.
They were plausible fellows, and liked to engage a friendly
policeman in conversation.
 
When the family assembled for Sunday dinner,
With their minds made up that they wouldn't get thinner
On Argentine joint, potatoes and greens,
And the cook would appear from behind the scenes
And say in a voice that was broken with sorrow:
""I'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow!
For the joint has gone from the oven-like that!""
Then the family would say: ""It's that horrible cat!
It was Mungojerrie--or Rumpelteazer!""-- And most of the time
they left it at that.
 
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer had a wonderful way of working
together.
And some of the time you would say it was luck, and some of
the time you would say it was weather.
They would go through the house like a hurricane, and no sober
person could take his oath

Was it Mungojerrie--or Rumpelteazer? or could you have sworn
that it mightn't be both?
 
And when you heard a dining-room smash
Or up from the pantry there came a loud crash
Or down from the library came a loud ping
From a vase which was commonly said to be Ming--
Then the family would say: ""Now which was which cat?
It was Mungojerrie! AND Rumpelteazer!""-- And there's nothing
at all to be done about that!

On the beach at night alone,
As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,
As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and

the future.
 
A vast similitude interlocks all,
All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
All distances of place however wide,
All distances of time, all inanimate forms,
All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in different worlds,
All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,
All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,
All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,
All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,
This vast similitude spans them, and always has spanned,
And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.

Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace--I hold up agitation
and conflict;
I praise no eminent man--I rebuke to his face the one that was
thought most worthy.
 
(Who are you? you mean devil! And what are you secretly guilty of,
all your life?
Will you turn aside all your life? Will you grub and chatter all your
life?)
 
(And who are you--blabbing by rote, years, pages, languages,
reminiscences,
Unwitting to-day that you do not know how to speak a single word?)
 
Let others finish specimens--I never finish specimens;
I shower them by exhaustless laws, as Nature does, fresh and modern
continually.
 
I give nothing as duties; 
What others give as duties, I give as living impulses;
(Shall I give the heart's action as a duty?)
 
Let others dispose of questions--I dispose of nothing--I arouse
unanswerable questions;
Who are they I see and touch, and what about them?
What about these likes of myself, that draw me so close by tender
directions and indirections?
 
I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends, but
listen to my enemies--as I myself do;
I charge you, too, forever, reject those who would expound me--for I
cannot expound myself;
I charge that there be no theory or school founded out of me;
I charge you to leave all free, as I have left all free.

After me, vista! 
O, I see life is not short, but immeasurably long;
I henceforth tread the world, chaste, temperate, an early riser, a
steady grower,
Every hour the semen of centuries--and still of centuries.
 
I will follow up these continual lessons of the air, water, earth;
I perceive I have no time to lose.

Psalm IV
Allen Ginsberg
Now I'll record my secret vision, impossible sight of the face of God:
It was no dream, I lay broad waking on a fabulous couch in Harlem
having masturbated for no love, and read half naked an open book of Blake
on my lap
Lo & behold! I was thoughtless and turned a page and gazed on the living
Sun-flower
and heard a voice, it was Blake's, reciting in earthen measure:
the voice rose out of the page to my secret ear never heard before-
I lifted my eyes to the window, red walls of buildings flashed outside,
endless sky sad Eternity
sunlight gazing on the world, apartments of Harlem standing in the
universe--
each brick and cornice stained with intelligence like a vast living face--
the great brain unfolding and brooding in wilderness!--Now speaking
aloud with Blake's voice--
Love! thou patient presence & bone of the body! Father! thy careful
watching and waiting over my soul!
My son! My son! the endless ages have remembered me! My son! My son!
Time howled in anguish in my ear!
My son! My son! my father wept and held me in his dead arms.

When I behold how black, immortal ink
Drips from my deathless pen - ah, well-away!
Why should we stop at all for what I think?
There is enough in what I chance to say.
 
It is enough that we once came together;
What is the use of setting it to rime?
When it is autumn do we get spring weather,
Or gather may of harsh northwindish time?
 
It is enough that we once came together;
What if the wind have turned against the rain?
It is enough that we once came together;
Time has seen this, and will not turn again;
 
And who are we, who know that last intent,
To plague to-morrow with a testament!

Two Views of a Cadaver Room
Sylvia Plath

The day she visited the dissecting room
They had four men laid out, black as burnt turkey,
Already half unstrung. A vinegary fume
Of the death vats clung to them;
The white-smocked boys started working.
The head of his cadaver had caved in,
And she could scarcely make out anything
In that rubble of skull plates and old leather.
A sallow piece of string held it together.
 
In their jars the snail-nosed babies moon and glow.
He hands her the cut-out heart like a cracked heirloom.
 

In Brueghel's panorama of smoke and slaughter
Two people only are blind to the carrion army:
He, afloat in the sea of her blue satin
Skirts, sings in the direction
Of her bare shoulder, while she bends,
Finger a leaflet of music, over him,
Both of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands
Of the death's-head shadowing their song.
These Flemish lovers flourish;not for long.
Yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little country
Foolish, delicate, in the lower right hand corner

The Tuft of Flowers
Robert Frost
I went to turn the grass once after one
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.
The dew was gone that made his blade so keen
Before I came to view the levelled scene.
I looked for him behind an isle of trees;
I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.
But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,
And I must be, as he had been,—alone,
""As all must be,"" I said within my heart,
""Whether they work together or apart.""
But as I said it, swift there passed me by
On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,
Seeking with memories grown dim over night
Some resting flower of yesterday's delight.
And once I marked his flight go round and round,
As where some flower lay withering on the ground.
And then he flew as far as eye could see,
And then on tremulous wing came back to me.
I thought of questions that have no reply,
And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;
But he turned first, and led my eye to look
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.
I left my place to know them by their name,
Finding them butterfly-weed when I came.
The mower in the dew had loved them thus,
By leaving them to flourish, not for us,
Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him,
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.
The butterfly and I had lit upon,
Nevertheless, a message from the dawn,
That made me hear the wakening birds around,
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,
And feel a spirit kindred to my own;
So that henceforth I worked no more alone;
But glad with him, I worked as with his aid,
And weary, sought at noon with him the shade;
And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.
""Men work together,"" I told him from the heart,
""Whether they work together or apart.""

The Earth
Anne Sexton
God loafs around heaven,
without a shape
but He would like to smoke His cigar
or bite His fingernails
and so forth.
 
God owns heaven
but He craves the earth,
the earth with its little sleepy caves,
its bird resting at the kitchen window,
even its murders lined up like broken chairs,
even its writers digging into their souls
with jackhammers,
even its hucksters selling their animals
for gold,
even its babies sniffing for their music,
the farm house, white as a bone,
sitting in the lap of its corn,
even the statue holding up its widowed life,
but most of all He envies the bodies,
He who has no body.
 
The eyes, opening and shutting like keyholes
and never forgetting, recording by thousands,
the skull with its brains like eels--
the tablet of the world--
the bones and their joints
that build and break for any trick,
the genitals,
the ballast of the eternal,
and the heart, of course,
that swallows the tides
and spits them out cleansed.
 
He does not envy the soul so much.
He is all soul
but He would like to house it in a body
and come down
and give it a bath
now and then.

I Died For Beauty

I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
 
He questioned softly why I failed?
""For beauty,"" I replied.
""And I for truth - the two are one;
We brethren are,"" he said.
 
And so, as kinsmen met a-night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.

What could such glory be

open again? Because in truth
I am speaking now

On Ears that dying lie--

To Eyes that Closing go--
Hangs so distant Heaven--

Sonnet (1928)

I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling finger-tips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!
 
There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.

It was only important
to smile and hold still,
to lie down beside him
and to rest awhile,
to be folded up together
as if we were silk,
to sink from the eyes of mother
and not to talk.
The black room took us
like a cave or a mouth
or an indoor belly.
I held my breath
and daddy was there,
his thumbs, his fat skull,
his teeth, his hair growing
like a field or a shawl.
I lay by the moss
of his skin until
it grew strange. My sisters
will never know that I fall
out of myself and pretend
that Allah will not see
how I hold my daddy
like an old stone tree.

Winter Landscape, With Rooks
Sylvia Plath
Water in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,
plunges headlong into that black pond
where, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan
floats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind
which hungers to haul the white reflection down.
 
The austere sun descends above the fen,
an orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look
longer on this landscape of chagrin;
feathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook,
brooding as the winter night comes on.
 
Last summer's reeds are all engraved in ice
as is your image in my eye; dry frost
glazes the window of my hurt; what solace
can be struck from rock to make heart's waste
grow green again? Who'd walk in this bleak place?

To A Friend Whose Work Has Come To Triumph

Consider Icarus, pasting those sticky wintgs on,
testing that strange little tug at his shoulder blade,
and think of that first flawless moment over the lawn
of the labyrinth. Think of the difference it made!
There below are the trees, as awkward as camels;
and here are the shocked starlings pumping past
and think of innocent Icarus who is doing quite well:
larger than a sail, over the fog and the blast
of the plushy ocean, he goes. Admire his wings!
Feel the fire at his neck and see how casually
he glances up and is caught, wondrously tunneling
into that hot eye. Who cares that feel back to the sea?
See him acclaiming the sun and come plunging down
while his sensible daddy goes straight into town.

And the grass rise.
 
And when lights begin to show
Up from the town,
I will mark which must be mine,
And then start down!

The Journey of the Magi
Thomas Stearns Eliot
'A cold coming we had of it,
Just the worst time of the year
For a journey, and such a long journey:
The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter.'
And the camels galled, sorefooted, refractory,
Lying down in the melting snow.
There were times we regretted
The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,
And the silken girls bringing sherbet.
Then the camel men cursing and grumbling
and running away, and wanting their liquor and women,
And the night-fires going out, and the lack of shelters,
And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly
And the villages dirty and charging high prices:
A hard time we had of it.
At the end we preferred to travel all night,
Sleeping in snatches,
With the voices singing in our ears, saying
That this was all folly.
 
Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,
Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;
With a running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness,
And three trees on the low sky,
And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.
Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,
Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,
And feet kiking the empty wine-skins.
But there was no information, and so we continued
And arriving at evening, not a moment too soon
Finding the place; it was (you might say) satisfactory.
 
All this was a long time ago, I remember,
And I would do it again, but set down
This set down
This: were we led all that way for
Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly
We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,
But had thought they were different; this Birth was
Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.
We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,
But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,
With an alien people clutching their gods.
I should be glad of another death.

Whispers of Immortality
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Webster was much possessed by death
And saw the skull beneath the skin;
And breastless creatures under ground
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.
 
Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.
 
Donne, I suppose, was such another
Who found no substitute for sense;
To seize and clutch and penetrate,
Expert beyond experience,
 
He knew the anguish of the marrow
The ague of the skeleton;
No contact possible to flesh
Allayed the fever of the bone.
. . . . .
Grishkin is nice: her
Russian eye is underlined for emphasis;
Uncorseted, her friendly bust
Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.
 
The couched Brazilian jaguar
Compels the scampering marmoset
With subtle effluence of cat;
Grishkin has a maisonette;
 
The sleek Brazilian jaguar
Does not in its arboreal gloom
Distil so rank a feline smell
As Grishkin in a drawing-room.
 
And even the Abstract Entities
Circumambulate her charm;
But our lot crawls between dry ribs
To keep our metaphysics warm

And all the trees in all the dales.

With nimble, gay and gracious airs:
And from Penzance to Maidenhead

While, swift and singing, smooth and strong
She gallops by the fields along.

Spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous,
And dying to say something unanswerable.

But in the daytime she is ridiculous.

Arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity,

in a big house with four

as long as I could remember,
I lay on the lawn at night,
clover wrinkling over me,
the wise stars bedding over me,
my mother's window a funnel
of yellow heat running out,
my father's window, half shut,
an eye where sleepers pass,
and the boards of the house
were smooth and white as wax
and probably a million leaves
sailed on their strange stalks
as the crickets ticked together
and I, in my brand new body,
which was not a woman's yet,
told the stars my questions
and thought God could really see
the heat and the painted light,
elbows, knees, dreams, goodnight.

The birches are mad with green points
the wood's edge is burning with their green,
burning, seething--No, no, no.
The birches are opening their leaves one
by one. Their delicate leaves unfold cold
and separate, one by one. Slender tassels
hang swaying from the delicate branch tips--
Oh, I cannot say it. There is no word.
Black is split at once into flowers. In
every bog and ditch, flares of
small fire, white flowers!--Agh,
the birches are mad, mad with their green.
The world is gone, torn into shreds
with this blessing. What have I left undone
that I should have undertaken?
 
O my brother, you redfaced, living man
ignorant, stupid whose feet are upon
this same dirt that I touch--and eat.
We are alone in this terror, alone,
face to face on this road, you and I,
wrapped by this flame!
Let the polished plows stay idle,
their gloss already on the black soil.
But that face of yours--!
Answer me. I will clutch you. I
will hug you, grip you. I will poke my face
into your face and force you to see me.
Take me in your arms, tell me the commonest
thing that is in your mind to say,
say anything. I will understand you--!
It is the madness of the birch leaves opening
cold, one by one.
 
My rooms will receive me. But my rooms
are no longer sweet spaces where comfort
is ready to wait on me with its crumbs.
A darkness has brushed them. The mass
of yellow tulips in the bowl is shrunken.
Every familiar object is changed and dwarfed.
I am shaken, broken against a might
that splits comfort, blows apart
my careful partitions, crushes my house
and leaves me--with shrinking heart
and startled, empty eyes--peering out
into a cold world.
 
In the spring I would be drunk! In the spring
I would be drunk and lie forgetting all things.
Your face! Give me your face, Yang Kue Fei!
your hands, your lips to drink!
Give me your wrists to drink--

I drag you, I am drowned in you, you
overwhelm me! Drink!
Save me! The shad bush is in the edge
of the clearing. The yards in a fury
of lilac blossoms are driving me mad with terror.
Drink and lie forgetting the world.
 
And coldly the birch leaves are opening one by one.
Coldly I observe them and wait for the end.
And it ends.

E.P. Ode Pour L'election De Son Sepulchre
Ezra Pound
For three years, out of key with his time,
He strove to resuscitate the dead art
Of poetry; to maintain ""the sublime""
In the old sense. Wrong from the start--
 
No, hardly, but seeing he had been born
In a half savage country, out of date;
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
Capaneus; trout for factitious bait;
 
Idmen gar toi panth, hos eni troie
Caught in the unstopped ear;
Giving the rocks small lee-way
The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.
 
His true Penelope was Flaubert,
He fished by obstinate isles;
Observed the elegance of Circe's hair
Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.
 
Unaffected by ""the march of events,""

No adjunct to the Muses' diadem.

The age demanded an image
Of its accelerated grimace,
Something for the modern stage
Not, at any rate, an Attic grace;
 
Not, certainly, the obscure reveries
Of the inward gaze;
Better mendacities
Than the classics in paraphrase!
 
The ""age demanded"" chiefly a mould in plaster,
Made with no loss of time,
A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster
Or the ""sculpture"" of rhyme.

The tea-rose tea-gown, etc.
Supplants the mousseline of Cos,
The pianola ""replaces""

Made way for macerations;
Caliban casts out Ariel.

All things are a flowing
Sage Heracleitus say;
But a tawdry cheapness
Shall outlast our days.
 
Even the Christian beauty
Defects--after Samothrace;
We see to kalon
Decreed in the market place.
 
Faun's flesh is not to us,
Nor the saint's vision.
We have the press for wafer;
Franchise for circumcision.
 
All men, in law, are equals.
Free of Pisistratus,
We choose a knave or an eunuch
To rule over us.
 
O bright Apollo,
Tin andra, tin heroa, tina theon,
What god, man or hero
Shall I place a tin wreath upon!

And some believing,

some from fear of weakness,
some from fear of censure,
some for love of slaughter, in imagination,

walked eye-deep in hell
believing old men's lies, then unbelieving
came home, home to a lie,
home to many deceits,
home to old lies and new infamy;
usury age-old and age-thick
and liars in public places.
 
Daring as never before, wastage as never before.
Young blood and high blood,
fair cheeks, and fine bodies;

fortitude as never before
 
frankness as never before,
disillusions as never told in the old days,
hysterias, trench confessions,
laughter out of dead bellies.

There died a myriad,
And of the best, among them,
For an old bitch gone in the teeth,
For a botched civilization,
 
Charm, smiling at the good mouth,
Quick eyes gone under earth's lid,
 
For two gross of broken statues,
For a few thousand battered books.

The Vantage Point
Robert Frost
If tires of trees I seek again mankind, Well I know where to hie me--in the dawn, To a
slope where the cattle keep the lawn. There amid loggin juniper reclined, Myself
unseen, I see in white defined Far off the homes of men, and farther still, The graves
of men on an opposing hill, Living or dead, whichever are to mind. And if by noon I
have too much of these, I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, The sun-burned hillside
sets my face aglow, My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, I smell the earth, I
smell the bruis&egrave;d plant, I look into the crater of the ant.

Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking
Walt Whitman
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight,
Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child
leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
Down from the shower'd halo,
Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as
if they were alive,
Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,
From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,
From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and
fallings I heard,
From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as
if with tears,
From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in
the mist,
From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,
From the myriad thence-arous'd words,
From the word stronger and more delicious than any,
From such as now they start the scene revisiting,
As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,
Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,
A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,
Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,
I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,
Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,
A reminiscence sing.
 
Once Paumanok,
When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass
was growing,
Up this seashore in some briers,
Two feather'd guests from Alabama, two together,
And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,
And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,
And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with
bright eyes,
And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never
disturbing them,
Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.
 
Shine! shine! shine!
Pour down your warmth, great sun!
While we bask, we two together.
 
Two together!
Winds blow south, or winds blow north,
Day come white, or niqht come black,
Home, or rivers and mountains from home,
Singing all time, minding no time,
While we two keep together.

Till of a sudden,
May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,
One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,
Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,
Nor ever appear'd again.
 
And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,
And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,
Over the hoarse surging of the sea,
Or flitting from brier to brier by day,
I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,
The solitary guest from Alabama.
 
Blow! blow! blow!
Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore;
I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.
 
Yes, when the stars glisten'd,
All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,
Down almost amid the slapping waves,
Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.
 
He call'd on his mate,
He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know.
Yes my brother I know,
The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note,
For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,
Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the
shadows,
Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds
and sights after their sorts,
The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
Listen'd long and long.
 
Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,
Following you my brother.
 
Soothe! soothe! soothe!
Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,
And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,
But my love soothes not me, not me.
 
Low hangs the moon, it rose late,
It is lagging--O I think it is heavy with love, with love.
 
O madly the sea pushes upon the land,
With love, with love.
 
O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?
What is that little black thing I see there in the white?

Loud! loud! loud!
Loud I call to you, my love!
 
Hiqh and clear I shoot my voice over the waves,
Surely you must know who is here, is here,
You must know who I am, my love.
 
Low-hanging moon!
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!
O moon do not keep her from me any longer.
 
Land! land! O land!
Whichever way I turn, 0 I think you could give me my mate
back again if you only would,
For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.
 
O rising stars!
Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.
 
O throat! 0 trembling throat!
Sound clearer through the atmosphere!
Pierce the woods, the earth,
Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.
 
Shake out carols!
Solitary here, the niqht's carols!
Carols of lonesome love! death's carols!
Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!
O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!
O reckless despairing carols.
 
But soft! sink low!
Soft! let me just murmur,
And do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea,
For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,
So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,
But not altogether still, for then she miqht not come immediately
to me.
 
Hither my love!
Here I am! here!
With this just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you,
This gentle call is for you my love, for you.
 
Do not be decoy'd elsewhere,
That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,
That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,
Those are the shadows of leaves.
 
O darkness! 0 in vain!
0 I am very sick and sorrowful.

O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!
O troubled reflection in the sea!
O throat! 0 throbbing heart!
And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the niqht.
 
0 past! 0 happy life! 0 songs of joy!
In the air, in the woods, over fields,
Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
But my mate no more, no more with me!
We two together no more.
 
The aria sinking,
All else continuing, the stars shining,
The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,
With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,
On the sands of Paumanok's shore gray and rustling,
The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping,
the face of the sea almost touching,
The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair
the atmosphere dallying,
The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last
tumultuously bursting,
The aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,
The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,
The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,
To the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd
secret hissing,
To the outsetting bard.
 
Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)
Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now I
have heard you,
Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,
And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer,
louder and more sorrowful than yours,
A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me,
never to die.
O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,
O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease
perpetuating you,
Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,
Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before
what there in the night,
By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,
The messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,
The unknown want, the destiny of me.
 
O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)
O if I am to have so much, let me have more!

A word then, (for I will conquer it,)
The word final, superior to all,
Subtle, sent up--what is it?--I listen;
Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-
waves?
Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
 
Whereto answering, the sea,
Delaying not, hurrying not,
Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before
daybreak,
Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,
And again death, death, death, death,
Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd
child's heart,
But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,
Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly
all over,
Death, death, death, death, death.
 
Which I do not forget,
But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray
beach,
With the thousand responsive songs at random,
My own songs awaked from that hour,
And with them the key, the word up from the waves,
The word of the sweetest song and all songs,
That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet
garments, bending aside,)
The sea whisper'd me.

Six Significant Landscapes
Wallace Stevens
I
An old man sits
In the shadow of a pine tree
In China.
He sees larkspur,
Blue and white,
At the edge of the shadow,
Move in the wind.
His beard moves in the wind.
The pine tree moves in the wind.
Thus water flows
Over weeds.
 
II
The night is of the colour
Of a woman's arm:
Night, the female,
Obscure,
Fragrant and supple,
Conceals herself.
A pool shines,
Like a bracelet
Shaken in a dance.
 
III
I measure myself
Against a tall tree.
I find that I am much taller,
For I reach right up to the sun,
With my eye;
And I reach to the shore of the sea
With my ear.
Nevertheless, I dislike
The way ants crawl
In and out of my shadow.
 
IV
When my dream was near the moon,
The white folds of its gown
Filled with yellow light.
The soles of its feet
Grew red.
Its hair filled
With certain blue crystallizations
From stars,
Not far off.
 
V
Not all the knives of the lamp-posts,
Nor the chisels of the long streets,
Nor the mallets of the domes
And high towers,

Can carve
What one star can carve,
Shining through the grape-leaves.
 
VI
Rationalists, wearing square hats,
Think, in square rooms,
Looking at the floor,
Looking at the ceiling.
They confine themselves
To right-angled triangles.
If they tried rhomboids,
Cones, waving lines, ellipses --
As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon --
Rationalists would wear sombreros.

The Gift Outright
Robert Frost
The land was ours before we were the land's.
She was our land more than a hundred years
Before we were her people. She was ours
In Massachusetts, in Virginia,
But we were England's, still colonials,
Possessing what we still were unpossessed by,
Possessed by what we now no more possessed.
Something we were withholding made us weak
Until we found out that it was ourselves
We were withholding from our land of living,
And forthwith found salvation in surrender.
Such as we were we gave ourselves outright
(The deed of gift was many deeds of war)
To the land vaguely realizing westward,
But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,
Such as she was, such as she would become.

Fragmentary Blue
Robert Frost
Why make so much of fragmentary blue
In here and there a bird, or butterfly,
Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,
When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)--
Though some savants make earth include the sky;
And blue so far above us comes so high,
It only gives our wish for blue a whet.

Sonnets From An Ungrafted Tree

I, being born a woman and distressed
By all the needs and notions of my kind,
Am urged by your propinquity to find
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest
To bear you body's weight upon my breast:
So subtly is the fume of life designed,
To clairfy the pulse and cloud the mind,
And leave me once again undone, possessed.
Think not for this, however, the poor treason
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,
I shall remember you with love, or season
My scorn with pity, -- let me make it plain:
I find ths frenzy insufficient reason
For conversation when we meet again.

And whistled in the air--

And gnashed their teeth--
And swung their frenzied hair.

The Monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast--
And peace--was Paradise!

Ecstatic bird songs pound
the hollow vastness of the sky
with metallic clinkings--
beating color up into it
at a far edge,--beating it, beating it
with rising, triumphant ardor,--
stirring it into warmth,
quickening in it a spreading change,--
bursting wildly against it as
dividing the horizon, a heavy sun
lifts himself--is lifted--
bit by bit above the edge
of things,--runs free at last
out into the open--!lumbering
glorified in full release upward--

He halted in the wind, and -- what was that
Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?
He stood there bringing March against his thought,
And yet too ready to believe the most.
""Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom,"" I said;
And truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
Such white luxuriance of May for ours.
We stood a moment so in a strange world,
Myself as one his own pretense deceives;
And then I said the truth (and we moved on).

Wakening the appetites of life in some

And I say, 'Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript.'

Four Quartets
Thomas Stearns Eliot
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all out exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
Through the unknown, remembered gate
When the last of earth left to discover
Is that which was the beginning;
At the source of the longest river
The voice of the hidden waterfall
And the children in the apple-tree
Not known, because not looked for
But heard, half heard, in the stillness
Between the two waves of the sea.
Quick now, here, now, always--
A condition of complete simplicity
(Costing not less than everything)
And all shall be well and
All manner of things shall be well
When the tongues of flame are in-folded
Into the crowned knot of fire
And the fire and the rose are one.

Five Flights Up

Still dark.
The unknown bird sits on his usual branch.
The little dog next door barks in his sleep
inquiringly, just once.
Perhaps in his sleep, too, the bird inquires
once or twice, quavering.
Questions---if that is what they are---
answered directly, simply,
by day itself.
 
Enormous morning, ponderous, meticulous;
gray light streaking each bare branch,
each single twig, along one side,
making another tree, of glassy veins...
The bird still sits there. Now he seems to yawn.
 
The little black dog runs in his yard.
His owner's voice arises, stern,
""You ought to be ashamed!""
What has he done?
He bounces cheerfully up and down;
he rushes in circles in the fallen leaves.
 
Obviously, he has no sense of shame.
He and the bird know everything is answered,
all taken care of,
no need to ask again.

Love Is Not All
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
And rise and sink and rise and sink again;
Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath,
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;
Yet many a man is making friends with death
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone.
It well may be that in a difficult hour,
Pinned down by pain and moaning for release,
Or nagged by want past resolution's power,
I might be driven to sell your love for peace,
Or trade the memory of this night for food.
It well may be. I do not think I would.

And there were flowers in your hand,

Was angry when they spoke your name
IN ordinary places.
I would that the cool waves might flow over my mind,
And that the world should dry as a dead leaf,
Or as a dandelion see-pod and be swept away,
So that I might find you again,
Alone.

The Need of Being Versed in Country Things
Robert Frost
The house had gone to bring again
To the midnight sky a sunset glow.
Now the chimney was all of the house that stood,
Like a pistil after the petals go.
The barn opposed across the way,
That would have joined the house in flame
Had it been the will of the wind, was left
To bear forsaken the place's name.
No more it opened with all one end
For teams that came by the stony road
To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs
And brush the mow with the summer load.
The birds that came to it through the air
At broken windows flew out and in,
Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
From too much dwelling on what has been.
Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,
And the aged elm, though touched with fire;
And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;
And the fence post carried a strand of wire.
For them there was really nothing sad.
But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,
One had to be versed in country things
Not to believe the phoebes wept.

There were some dirty plates
and a glass of milk
beside her on a small table
near the rank, disheveled bed--
 
Wrinkled and nearly blind
she lay and snored
rousing with anger in her tones
to cry for food,
 
Gimme something to eat--
They're starving me--
I'm all right--I won't go
to the hospital.No, no, no
 
Give me something to eat!
Let me take you
to the hospital, I said
and after you are well
 
you can do as you please.
She smiled, Yes

Is this what you call

By now her mind was clear--
Oh you think you're smart

she said, but I'll tell you
you don't know anything.
Then we started.
On the way
 
we passed a long row
of elms. She looked at them
awhile out of
the ambulance window and said,
 
What are all those
fuzzy looking things out there?
Trees?Well, I'm tired
of them and rolled her head away.

The True Encounter
Edna St. Vincent Millay
""Wolf!"" cried my cunning heart
At every sheep it spied,
And roused the countryside.
 
""Wolf! Wolf!"" -- and up would start
Good neighbours, bringing spade
And pitchfork to my aid.
 
At length my cry was known:
Therein lay my release.
I met the wolf alone
And was devoured in peace.

Bless God, he went as soldiers
Emily Dickinson

 
Bless God, he went as soldiers,
His musket on his breast--
Grant God, he charge the bravest
Of all the martial blest!
 
Please God, might I behold him
In epauletted white--
I should not fear the foe then--
I should not fear the fight!

To a Friend Concerning Several Ladies
William Carlos Williams
You know there is not much
that I desire, a few chrysanthemums
half lying on the grass, yellow
and brown and white, the
talk of a few people, the trees,
an expanse of dried leaves perhaps
with ditches among them.
 
But there comes
between me and these things
a letter
or even a look--well placed,
you understand,
so that I am confused, twisted
four ways and--left flat,
unable to lift the food to
my own mouth:
Here is what they say: Come!
and come! and come! And if
I do not go I remain stale to
myself and if I go--
I have watched
the city from a distance at night
and wondered why I wrote no poem.
Come! yes,
the city is ablaze for you
and you stand and look at it.
 
And they are right. There is
no good in the world except out of
a woman and certain women alone
for certain. But what if
I arrive like a turtle,
with my house on my back or
a fish ogling from under water?
It will not do. I must be
steaming with love, colored
like a flamingo. For what?
To have legs and a silly head
and to smell, pah! like a flamingo
that soils its own feathers behind.
Must I go home filled
with a bad poem?
And they say:
Who can answer these things
till he has tried? Your eyes
are half closed, you are a child,
oh, a sweet one, ready to play
but I will make a man of you and
with love on his shoulder--!
 
And in the marshes

the crickets run
on the sunny dike's top and
make burrows there, the water
reflects the reeds and the reeds
move on their stalks and rattle drily.

The Bee Meeting
Sylvia Plath
Who are these people at the bridge to meet me? They are the villagers----
The rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees.
In my sleeveless summery dress I have no protection,
And they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me?
They are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats.
 
I am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me?
Yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock,
Buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees.
Now I am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice.
They will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear.
 
Which is the rector now, is it that man in black?
Which is the midwife, is that her blue coat?
Everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors,
Breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits.
Their smiles and their voces are changing. I am led through a beanfield.
 
Strips of tinfoil winking like people,
Feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers,
Creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts.
Is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string?
No, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible.
 
Now they are giving me a fashionable white straw Italian hat
And a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them.
They are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives.
Is it the hawthorn that smells so sick?
The barren body of hawthon, etherizing its children.
 
Is it some operation that is taking place?
It is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for,
This apparition in a green helmet,
Shining gloves and white suit.
Is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone I know?
 
I cannot run, I am rooted, and the gorse hurts me
With its yellow purses, its spiky armory.
I could not run without having to run forever.
The white hive is snug as a virgin,
Sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming.
 
Smoke rolls and scarves in the grove.
The mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything.
Here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics.
If I stand very still, they will think I am cow-parsley,
A gullible head untouched by their animosity,
 
Not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow.
The villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen.
Is she hiding, is she eating honey? She is very clever.
She is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it.

While in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins
 
Dream of a duel they will win inevitably,
A curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,
The upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her.
The villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing.
The old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful?
 
I am exhausted, I am exhausted ----
Pillar of white in a blackout of knives.
I am the magician's girl who does not flinch.
The villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands.
Whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished, why am I
cold.

Sonnet 06: Bluebeard
Edna St. Vincent Millay
This door you might not open, and you did;
So enter now, and see for what slight thing
You are betrayed.... Here is no treasure hid
No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain
For greed like yours, no writhings of distress
But only what you see.... Look yet again -- 
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless
Yet this alone out of my life I kept
Unto myself, lest any know me quite;
And you did so profane me when you crept
Unto the threshold of this room to-night
That I must never more behold your face.
This now is yours. I seek another place.

Three Songs Of Shattering
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I
 
The first rose on my rose-tree
Budded, bloomed, and shattered,
During sad days when to me
Nothing mattered.
 
Grief of grief has drained me clean;
Still it seems a pity
No one saw, -- it must have been
Very pretty.
 
II
 
Let the little birds sing;
Let the little lambs play;
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring; -- 
But not in the old way!
 
I recall a place
Where a plum-tree grew;
There you lifted up your face,
And blossoms covered you.
 
If the little birds sing,
And the little lambs play,
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring -- 
But not in the old way!
 
III
 
All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree!
Ere spring was going -- ah, spring is gone!
And there comes no summer to the like of you and me, -- 
Blossom time is early, but no fruit sets on.
 
All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree,
Browned at the edges, turned in a day;
And I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me,
And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way!

Sonnet
Elizabeth Bishop
I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling finger-tips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!
 
There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.

The Hollow Men
Thomas Stearns Eliot
I
 
We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar
 
Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;
 
Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom
Remember us -- if at all -- not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.
 
II
 
Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dream kingdom
These do not appear:
There, the eyes are
Sunlight on a broken column
There, is a tree swinging
And voices are
In the wind's singing
More distant and more solemn
Than a fading star.
 
Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom
Let me also wear
Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer --
 
Not that final meeting
In the twilight kingdom
 
III

This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
Are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star.
 
Is it like this
In death's other kingdom
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone.
 
IV
 
The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
 
In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river
 
Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men.

Conversation Among the Ruins
Sylvia Plath
Through portico of my elegant house you stalk
With your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit
And the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net
Of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back.
Now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croak
Above the appalling ruin; in bleak light
Of your stormy eye, magic takes flight
Like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break.
 
Fractured pillars frame prospects of rock;
While you stand heroic in coat and tie, I sit
Composed in Grecian tunic and psyche-knot,
Rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic:
Which such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate,
What ceremony of words can patch the havoc?

People that build their houses inland,
People that buy a plot of ground
Shaped like a house, and build a house there,
Far from the sea-board, far from the sound
 
Of water sucking the hollow ledges,
Tons of water striking the shore, -- 
What do they long for, as I long for
One salt smell of the sea once more?
 
People the waves have not awakened,
Spanking the boats at the harbour's head,
What do they long for, as I long for, -- 
Starting up in my inland bed,
 
Beating the narrow walls, and finding
Neither a window nor a door,
Screaming to God for death by drowning, -- 
One salt taste of the sea once more?

Now Close The Windows

Now close the windows and hush all the fields:
If the trees must, let them silently toss;
No bird is singing now, and if there is,

I will be long ere the earliest bird:
So close the windows and not hear the wind,
But see all wind-stirred.

that pulse which is the narrative

will lead us away; our ship

Welcome Morning
Anne Sexton
There is joy
in all:
in the hair I brush each morning,
in the Cannon towel, newly washed,
that I rub my body with each morning,
in the chapel of eggs I cook
each morning,
in the outcry from the kettle
that heats my coffee
each morning,
in the spoon and the chair
that cry &quot;hello there, Anne&quot;
each morning,
in the godhead of the table
that I set my silver, plate, cup upon
each morning.
 
All this is God,
right here in my pea-green house
each morning
and I mean,
though often forget,
to give thanks,
to faint down by the kitchen table
in a prayer rejoicing
as the holy birds at the kitchen window
peek into their marriage of seeds.
 
So while I think of it,
let me paint a thank-you on my palm
for this God, this laughter of the morning,
lest it go unspoken.
 
The Joy that isn't shared, I've heard,
dies young.

For the Year of the Insane
Anne Sexton
<i>a prayer</i>
 
O Mary, fragile mother,
hear me, hear me now
although I do not know your words.
The black rosary with its silver Christ
lies unblessed in my hand
for I am the unbeliever.
Each bead is round and hard between my fingers,
a small black angel.
O Mary, permit me this grace,
this crossing over,
although I am ugly,
submerged in my own past
and my own madness.
Although there are chairs
I lie on the floor.
Only my hands are alive,
touching beads.
Word for word, I stumble.
A beginner, I feel your mouth touch mine.
 
I count beads as waves,
hammering in upon me.
I am ill at their numbers,
sick, sick in the summer heat
and the window above me
is my only listener, my awkward being.
She is a large taker, a soother.
The giver of breath
she murmurs,
exhaling her wide lung like an enormous fish.
 
Closer and closer
comes the hour of my death
as I rearrange my face, grow back,
grow undeveloped and straight-haired.
All this is death.
In the mind there is a thin alley called death
and I move through it as
through water.
My body is useless.
It lies, curled like a dog on the carpet.
It has given up.
There are no words here except the half-learned,
the Hail Mary and the full of grace.
Now I have entered the year without words.
I note the queer entrance and the exact voltage.
Without words they exist.
Without words on my touch bread
and be handed bread
and make no sound.

O Mary, tender physician,
come with powders and herbs
for I am in the center.
It is very small and the air is gray
as in a steam house.
I am handed wine as a child is handed milk.
It is presented in a delicate glass
with a round bowl and a thin lip.
The wine itself is pitch-colored, musty and secret.
The glass rises in its own toward my mouth
and I notice this and understand this
only because it has happened.
 
I have this fear of coughing
but I do not speak,
a fear of rain, a fear of the horseman
who comes riding into my mouth.
The glass tilts in on its own
and I amon fire.
I see two thin streaks burn down my chin.
I see myself as one would see another.
I have been cut int two.
 
O Mary, open your eyelids.
I am in the domain of silence,
the kingdom of the crazy and the sleeper.
There is blood here.
and I haven't eaten it.
O mother of the womb,
did I come for blood alone?
O little mother,
I am in my own mind.
I am locked in the wrong house.

A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.
 
A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!
 
The dust replaced in hoisted roa
The birds jocoser sung;
The sunshine threw his hat away,
The orchards spangles hung.

And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.

Portrait d'une Femme
Ezra Pound
Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea,
London has swept about you this score years
And bright ships left you this or that in fee:
Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things,
Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price.
Great minds have sought you -- lacking someone else.
You have been second always. Tragical?
No. You preferred it to the usual thing:
One dull man, dulling and uxorious,
One average mind -- with one thought less, each year.
Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit
Hours, where something might have floated up.
And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.
You are a person of some interest, one comes to you
And takes strange gain away:
Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion;
Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two,
Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else
That might prove useful and yet never proves,
That never fits a corner or shows use,
Or finds its hour upon the loom of days:
The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work;
Idols and ambergris and rare inlays,
These are your riches, your great store; and yet
For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things,
Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff:
In the slow float of differing light and deep,
No! there is nothing! In the whole and all,
Nothing that's quite your own.
Yet this is you.

Own thier cabbage roots, a space of stars,

Stripped of its secret, open, stark and bleak,
Blackens afar the half-forgotten creek, -- 
Then leans on me the weight of the year, and crushes

And will be born again, -- but ah, to see

I cried at Pity—not at Pain
Emily Dickinson

 
I cried at Pity—not at Pain—
I heard a Woman say
""Poor Child""—and something in her voice
Convicted me—of me—
 
So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things—
To look at, like a Toy—
 
To sometimes hear ""Rich people"" buy
And see the Parcel rolled—
And carried, I supposed—to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold—
 
But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh—
And so and so—had been to me,
Had God willed differently.
 
I wish I knew that Woman's name—
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say
 
She's ""sorry I am dead""—again—
Just when the Grave and I—
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby—

Baby Picture
Anne Sexton
It's in the heart of the grape
where that smile lies.
It's in the good-bye-bow in the hair
where that smile lies.
It's in the clerical collar of the dress
where that smile lies.
What smile?
The smile of my seventh year,
caught here in the painted photograph.
 
It's peeling now, age has got it,
a kind of cancer of the background
and also in the assorted features.
It's like a rotten flag
or a vegetable from the refrigerator,
pocked with mold.
I am aging without sound,
into darkness, darkness.
 
Anne,
who are you?
 
I open the vein
and my blood rings like roller skates.
I open the mouth
and my teeth are an angry army.
I open the eyes
and they go sick like dogs
with what they have seen.
I open the hair
and it falls apart like dust balls.
I open the dress
and I see a child bent on a toilet seat.
I crouch there, sitting dumbly
pushing the enemas out like ice cream,
letting the whole brown world
turn into sweets.
 
Anne,
who are you?
 
Merely a kid keeping alive.

Inscription
Walt Whitman
SMALL is the theme of the following Chant, yet the greatest--namely,
One's-Self--that wondrous thing a simple, separate person.
That, for the use of the New World, I sing.
Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy
alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse;--I say the Form
complete is worthier far. The female equal with the male, I
sing,
Nor cease at the theme of One's-Self. I speak the word of the modern,
the word En-Masse:
My Days I sing, and the Lands--with interstice I knew of hapless War.
 
O friend whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, I feel
through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I return.
And thus upon our journey link'd together let us go.

I Know I Am But Summer To Your Heart
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I know I am but summer to your heart,
And not the full four seasons of the year;
And you must welcome from another part
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear.
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;
And I have loved you all too long and well
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,
That you may hail anew the bird and rose
When I come back to you, as summer comes.
Else will you seek, at some not distant time,
Even your summer in another clime.

The Ballad Of The Harp-Weaver
Edna St. Vincent Millay
""Son,"" said my mother,
When I was knee-high,
""you've need of clothes to cover you,
and not a rag have I.
 
""There's nothing in the house
To make a boy breeches,
Nor shears to cut a cloth with,
Nor thread to take stitches.
 
""There's nothing in the house
But a loaf-end of rye,
And a harp with a woman's head
Nobody will buy,""
And she began to cry.
 
That was in the early fall.
When came the late fall,
""Son,"" she said, ""the sight of you
Makes your mother's blood crawl, -- 
 
""Little skinny shoulder-blades
Sticking through your clothes!
And where you'll get a jacket from
God above knows.
 
""It's lucky for me, lad,
Your daddy's in the ground,
And can't see the way I let
His son go around!""
And she made a queer sound.
 
That was in the late fall.
When the winter came,
I'd not a pair of breeches
Nor a shirt to my name.
 
I couldn't go to school,
Or out of doors to play.
And all the other little boys
Passed our way.
 
""Son,"" said my mother,
""Come, climb into my lap,
And I'll chafe your little bones
While you take a nap.""
 
And, oh, but we were silly
For half and hour or more,
Me with my long legs,
Dragging on the floor,

A-rock-rock-rocking
To a mother-goose rhyme!
Oh, but we were happy
For half an hour's time!
 
But there was I, a great boy,
And what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me
To sleep all day,
In such a daft way?
 
Men say the winter
Was bad that year;
Fuel was scarce,
And food was dear.
 
A wind with a wolf's head
Howled about our door,
And we burned up the chairs
And sat upon the floor.
 
All that was left us
Was a chair we couldn't break,
And the harp with a woman's head
Nobody would take,
For song or pity's sake.
 
The night before Christmas
I cried with cold,
I cried myself to sleep
Like a two-year old.
 
And in the deep night
I felt my mother rise,
And stare down upon me
With love in her eyes.
 
I saw my mother sitting
On the one good chair,
A light falling on her
From I couldn't tell where.
 
Looking nineteen,
And not a day older,
And the harp with a woman's head
Leaned against her shoulder.
 
Her thin fingers, moving
In the thin, tall strings,
Were weav-weav-weaving
Wonderful things.

Many bright threads,
From where I couldn't see,
Were running through the harp-strings
Rapidly,
 
And gold threads whistling
Through my mother's hand.
I saw the web grow,
And the pattern expand.
 
She wove a child's jacket,
And when it was done
She laid it on the floor
And wove another one.
 
She wove a red cloak
So regal to see,
""She's made it for a king's son,""
I said, ""and not for me.""
But I knew it was for me.
 
She wove a pair of breeches
Quicker than that!
She wove a pair of boots
And a little cocked hat.
 
She wove a pair of mittens,
Shw wove a little blouse,
She wove all night
In the still, cold house.
 
She sang as she worked,
And the harp-strings spoke;
Her voice never faltered,
And the thread never broke,
And when I awoke, -- 
 
There sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder,
Looking nineteeen,
And not a day older,
 
A smile about her lips,
And a light about her head,
And her hands in the harp-strings
Frozen dead.
 
And piled beside her
And toppling to the skies,
Were the clothes of a king's son,
Just my size.

Could live--did live
Emily Dickinson

 
Could live--did live--
Could die--did die--
Could smile upon the whole
Through faith in one he met not,
To introduce his soul.
 
Could go from scene familiar
To an untraversed spot--
Could contemplate the journey
With unpuzzled heart--
 
Such trust had one among us,
Among us not today--
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay!

As At Thy Portals Also Death
Walt Whitman
AS at thy portals also death,
Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds,
To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, maternity,
To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from me,
(I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still,
I sit by the form in the coffin,
I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips, the cheeks,
the closed eyes in the coffin;)
To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of earth, life,
love, to me the best,
I grave a monumental line, before I go, amid these songs,
And set a tombstone here.

Music Swims Back to Me
Anne Sexton
Wait Mister. Which way is home?
They turned the light out
and the dark is moving in the corner.
There are no sign posts in this room,
four ladies, over eighty,
in diapers every one of them.
La la la, Oh music swims back to me
and I can feel the tune they played
the night they left me
in this private institution on a hill.
 
Imagine it. A radio playing
and everyone here was crazy.
I liked it and danced in a circle.
Music pours over the sense
and in a funny way
music sees more than I.
I mean it remembers better;
remembers the first night here.
It was the strangled cold of November;
even the stars were strapped in the sky
and that moon too bright
forking through the bars to stick me
with a singing in the head.
I have forgotten all the rest.
 
They lock me in this chair at eight a.m.
and there are no signs to tell the way,
just the radio beating to itself
and the song that remembers
more than I. Oh, la la la,
this music swims back to me.
The night I came I danced a circle
and was not afraid.

Widows
Louise Gluck
My mother's playing cards with my aunt,
Spite and Malice, the family pastime, the game
my grandmother taught all her daughters.
 
Midsummer: too hot to go out.
Today, my aunt's ahead; she's getting the good cards.
My mother's dragging, having trouble with her concentration.
She can't get used to her own bed this summer.
She had no trouble last summer,
getting used to the floor. She learned to sleep there
to be near my father.
He was dying; he got a special bed.
 
My aunt doesn't give an inch, doesn't make
allowance for my mother's weariness.
It's how they were raised: you show respect by fighting.
To let up insults the opponent.
 
Each player has one pile to the left, five cards in the hand.
It's good to stay inside on days like this,
to stay where it's cool.
And this is better than other games, better than solitaire.
 
My grandmother thought ahead; she prepared her daughters.
They have cards; they have each other.
They don't need any more companionship.
 
All afternoon the game goes on but the sun doesn't move.
It just keeps beating down, turning the grass yellow.
That's how it must seem to my mother.
And then, suddenly, something is over.
 
My aunt's been at it longer; maybe that's why she's playing better.
Her cards evaporate: that's what you want, that's the object: in the end,
the one who has nothing wins.

Since Christmas they have lived with us,
Guileless and clear,
Oval soul-animals,
Taking up half the space,
Moving and rubbing on the silk
 
Invisible air drifts,
Giving a shriek and pop
When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.
Yellow cathead, blue fish--------
Such queer moons we live with
 
Instead of dead furniture!
Straw mats, white walls
And these traveling
Globes of thin air, red, green,
Delighting
 
The heart like wishes or free
Peacocks blessing
Old ground with a feather
Beaten in starry metals.
Your small
 
Brother is making
His balloon squeak like a cat.
Seeming to see
A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,
He bites,
 
Then sits
Back, fat jug
Contemplating a world clear as water.
A red
Shred in his little fist.

Of definite Sunday faces;
Bonnets, silk hats, and conscious graces
In repetition that displaces
Your mental self-possession
By this unwarranted digression.
 
Evening, lights, and tea!
Children and cats in the alley;
Dejection unable to rally
Against this dull conspiracy.
 
And Life, a little bald and gray,
Languid, fastidious, and bland,
Waits, hat and gloves in hand,
Punctilious of tie and suit
(Somewhat impatient of delay)
On the doorstep of the Absolute.

in such a silence as i know, or such
great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;

Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame.
Take the moral law and make a nave of it
And from the nave build haunted heaven. Thus,
The conscience is converted into palms,
Like windy citherns hankering for hymns.
We agree in principle. That's clear. But take
The opposing law and make a peristyle,
And from the peristyle project a masque
Beyond the planets. Thus, our bawdiness,
Unpurged by epitaph, indulged at last,
Is equally converted into palms,
Squiggling like saxophones. And palm for palm,
Madame, we are where we began. Allow,
Therefore, that in the planetary scene
Your disaffected flagellants, well-stuffed,
Smacking their muzzy bellies in parade,
Proud of such novelties of the sublime,
Such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk,
May, merely may, madame, whip from themselves
A jovial hullabaloo among the spheres.
This will make widows wince. But fictive things
Wink as they will. Wink most when widows wince.

Or smoothed a homely pain,
Or pushed the pebble from his path--
Or played his chosen tune--
 
On Lute the least--the latest--
But just his Ear could know
That whatsoe'er delighted it,
I never would let go--
 
The foot to bear his errand--
A little Boot I know--
Would leap abroad like Antelope--
With just the grant to do--
 
His weariest Commandment--
A sweeter to obey,
Than ""Hide and Seek""--
Or skip to Flutes--
Or all Day, chase the Bee--

The World, will have its own--to do--
The Dust, will vex your Fame--

To make your Cottage gay--

The Touch
Anne Sexton
For months my hand was sealed off
in a tin box. Nothing was there but the subway railings.
Perhaps it is bruised, I thought,
and that is why they have locked it up.
You could tell time by this, I thought,
like a clock, by its five knuckles
and the thin underground veins.
It lay there like an unconscious woman
fed by tubes she knew not of.
 
The hand had collapse,
a small wood pigeon
that had gone into seclusion.
I turned it over and the palm was old,
its lines traced like fine needlepoint
and stitched up into fingers.
It was fat and soft and blind in places.
Nothing but vulnerable.
 
And all this is metaphor.
An ordinary hand -- just lonely
for something to touch
that touches back.
The dog won't do it.
Her tail wags in the swamp for a frog.
I'm no better than a case of dog food.
She owns her own hunger.
My sisters won't do it.
They live in school except for buttons
and tears running down like lemonade.
My father won't do it.
He comes in the house and even at night
he lives in a machine made by my mother
and well oiled by his job, his job.
 
The trouble is
that I'd let my gestures freeze.
The trouble was not
in the kitchen or the tulips
but only in my head, my head.
 
Then all this became history.
Your hand found mine.
Life rushed to my fingers like a blood clot.
Oh, my carpenter,
the fingers are rebuilt.
They dance with yours.
They dance in the attic and in Vienna.
My hand is alive all over America.
Not even death will stop it,
death shedding her blood.
Nothing will stop it, for this is the kingdom

and the kingdom come.

ON journeys through the States we start,
(Ay, through the world--urged by these songs,
Sailing henceforth to every land--to every sea;)
We, willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.
 
We have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves, and passing on,
We have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the
seasons, and effuse as much?
 
We dwell a while in every city and town;
We pass through Kanada, the north-east, the vast valley of the
Mississippi, and the Southern States;
We confer on equal terms with each of The States,
We make trial of ourselves, and invite men and women to hear; 
We say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the body
and the Soul;
Dwell a while and pass on--Be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,
And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,
And may be just as much as the seasons.

Angels Of The Love Affair
Anne Sexton
""Angels of the love affair, do you know that other,
the dark one, that other me?""
 
1. ANGEL OF FIRE AND GENITALS
 
Angel of fire and genitals, do you know slime,
that green mama who first forced me to sing,
who put me first in the latrine, that pantomime
of brown where I was beggar and she was king?
I said, ""The devil is down that festering hole.""
Then he bit me in the buttocks and took over my soul.
Fire woman, you of the ancient flame, you
of the Bunsen burner, you of the candle,
you of the blast furnace, you of the barbecue,
you of the fierce solar energy, Mademoiselle,
take some ice, take come snow, take a month of rain
and you would gutter in the dark, cracking up your brain.
 
Mother of fire, let me stand at your devouring gate
as the sun dies in your arms and you loosen it's terrible weight.
 
2. ANGEL OF CLEAN SHEETS
 
Angel of clean sheets, do you know bedbugs?
Once in the madhouse they came like specks of cinnamon
as I lay in a choral cave of drugs,
as old as a dog, as quiet as a skeleton.
Little bits of dried blood. One hundred marks
upon the sheet. One hundred kisses in the dark.
White sheets smelling of soap and Clorox
have nothing to do with this night of soil,
nothing to do with barred windows and multiple locks
and all the webbing in the bed, the ultimate recoil.
I have slept in silk and in red and in black.
I have slept on sand and, on fall night, a haystack.
 
I have known a crib. I have known the tuck-in of a child
but inside my hair waits the night I was defiled.
 
3. ANGEL OF FLIGHT AND SLEIGH BELLS
 
Angel of flight and sleigh bells, do you know paralysis,
that ether house where your arms and legs are cement?
You are as still as a yardstick. You have a doll's kiss.
The brain whirls in a fit. The brain is not evident.
I have gone to that same place without a germ or a stroke.
A little solo act--that lady with the brain that broke.

In this fashion I have become a tree.
I have become a vase you can pick up or drop at will,
inanimate at last. What unusual luck! My body
passively resisting. Part of the leftovers. Part of the kill.
Angels of flight, you soarer, you flapper, you floater,
you gull that grows out of my back in the drreams I prefer,
 
stay near. But give me the totem. Give me the shut eye
where I stand in stone shoes as the world's bicycle goes by.
 
4. ANGEL OF HOPE AND CALENDARS
 
Angel of hope and calendars, do you know despair?
That hole I crawl into with a box of Kleenex,
that hole where the fire woman is tied to her chair,
that hole where leather men are wringing their necks,
where the sea has turned into a pond of urine.
There is no place to wash and no marine beings to stir in.
 
In this hole your mother is crying out each day.
Your father is eating cake and digging her grave.
In this hole your baby is strangling. Your mouth is clay.
Your eyes are made of glass. They break. You are not brave.
You are alone like a dog in a kennel. Your hands
break out in boils. Your arms are cut and bound by bands
 
of wire. Your voice is out there. Your voice is strange.
There are no prayers here. Here there is no change.
 
5. ANGEL OF BLIZZARDS AND BLACKOUTS
 
Angle of blizzards and blackouts, do you know raspberries,
those rubies that sat in the gree of my grandfather's garden?
You of the snow tires, you of the sugary wings, you freeze
me out. Leet me crawl through the patch. Let me be ten.
Let me pick those sweet kisses, thief that I was,
as the sea on my left slapped its applause.
 
Only my grandfather was allowed there. Or the maid
who came with a scullery pan to pick for breakfast.
She of the rols that floated in the air, she of the inlaid
woodwork all greasy with lemon, she of the feather and dust,
not I. Nonetheless I came sneaking across the salt lawn
in bare feet and jumping-jack pajamas in the spongy dawn.
 
Oh Angel of the blizzard and blackout, Madam white face,
take me back to that red mouth, that July 21st place.

6. ANGEL OF BEACH HOUSES AND PICNICS
 
Angel of beach houses and picnics, do you know solitaire?
Fifty-two reds and blacks and only myslef to blame.
My blood buzzes like a hornet's nest. I sit in a kitchen chair
at a table set for one. The silverware is the same
and the glass and the sugar bowl. I hear my lungs fill and expel
as in an operation. But I have no one left to tell.
 
Once I was a couple. I was my own king and queen
with cheese and bread and ros&eacute; on the rocks of Rockport.
Once I sunbathed in the buff, all brown and lean,
watching the toy sloops go by, holding court
for busloads of tourists. Once I called breakfast the sexiest
meal of the day. Once I invited arrest
 
at the peace march in Washington. Once I was young and bold
and left hundreds of unmatched people out in the cold.

Among cinquefoil, as the toothed moon rises:
 
This is the barrenness
Of harvest or pestilence

With her hand extended, as in payment,

Distinct, gold, calling
Come here

Emily Dickinson

 
As Watchers hang upon the East,
As Beggars revel at a feast
By savory Fancy spread--
As brooks in deserts babble sweet
On ear too far for the delight,
Heaven beguiles the tired.
 
As that same watcher, when the East
Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go--
That Beggar, when an honored Guest,
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed,
Heaven to us, if true.

Souvenir
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Just a rainy day or two
In a windy tower,
That was all I had of you -- 
Saving half an hour.
 
Marred by greeting passing groups
In a cinder walk,
Near some naked blackberry hoops
Dim with purple chalk.
I remember three or four
Things you said in spite,
And an ugly coat you wore,
Plaided black and white.
 
Just a rainy day or two
And a bitter word.
Why do I remember you
As a singing bird?

Blackberrying
Sylvia Plath
Nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,
Blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,
A blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea
Somewhere at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries
Big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
Ebon in the hedges, fat
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers.
I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me.
They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.
 
Overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks ---
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky.
Theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting.
I do not think the sea will appear at all.
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within.
I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen.
The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven.
One more hook, and the berries and bushes end.
 
The only thing to come now is the sea.
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,
Slapping its phantom laundry in my face.
These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt.
I follow the sheep path between them. A last hook brings me
To the hills' northern face, and the face is orange rock
That looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space
Of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths
Beating and beating at an intractable metal.

sometimes i am alive because with

who in my shoulder sinks sweetly teeth

Cino
Ezra Pound
Italian Campagna 1309, the open road
 
Bah! I have sung women in three cities,
But it is all the same;
And I will sing of the sun.
 
Lips, words, and you snare them,
Dreams, words, and they are as jewels,
Strange spells of old deity,
Ravens, nights, allurement:
And they are not;
Having become the souls of song.
 
Eyes, dreams, lips, and the night goes.
Being upon the road once more,
They are not.
Forgetful in their towers of our tuneing
Once for wind-runeing
They dream us-toward and
Sighing, say, ``Would Cino,
Passionate Cino, of the wrinkling eyes,
Gay Cino, of quick laughter,
Cino, of the dare, the jibe.
Frail Cino, strongest of his tribe
That tramp old ways beneath the sun-light,
Would Cino of the Luth were here!''
 
Once, twice a year---
Vaguely thus word they:
 
``Cino?'' ``Oh, eh, Cino Polnesi
The singer is't you mean?''
``Ah yes, passed once our way,
A saucy fellow, but . . .
(Oh they are all one these vagabonds),
Peste! 'tis his own songs?
Or some other's that he sings?
But *you*, My Lord, how with your city?''
 
My you ``My Lord,'' God's pity!
And all I knew were out, My Lord, you
Were Lack-land Cino, e'en as I am,
O Sinistro.
 
I have sung women in three cities.
But it is all one.
I will sing of the sun.
. . . eh? . . . they mostly had grey eyes,
But it is all one, I will sing of the sun.
 
``'Pollo Phoibee, old tin pan, you
Glory to Zeus' aegis-day,

Shield o' steel-blue, th' heaven o'er us
Hath for boss thy lustre gay!
 
'Pollo Phoibee, to our way-fare
Make thy laugh our wander-lied;
Bid thy 'flugence bear away care.
Cloud and rain-tears pass they fleet!
 
Seeking e'er the new-laid rast-way
To the gardens of the sun . . .

Edna St. Vincent Millay
Listen, children:
Your father is dead.
From his old coats
I'll make you little jackets;
I'll make you little trousers
From his old pants.
There'll be in his pockets
Things he used to put there,
Keys and pennies
Covered with tobacco;
Dan shall have the pennies
To save in his bank;
Anne shall have the keys
To make a pretty noise with.
Life must go on,
And the dead be forgotten;
Life must go on,
Though good men die;
Anne, eat your breakfast;
Dan, take your medicine;
Life must go on;
I forget just why.

The years of loving you in both
Your presence and absence, regret

That forbid me to keep you, the sea
A sheet of glass, the sun-bleached
Beauty of the Greek ships: how
Could I have power if
I had no wish
To transform you: as
You loved my body,
As you found there
Passion we held above
All other gifts, in that single moment
Over honor and hope, over
Loyalty, in the name of that bond
I refuse you
Such feeling for your wife
As will let you
Rest with her, I refuse you
Sleep again
If I cannot have you.

The light is like a spider.
It crawls over the water.
It crawls over the edges of the snow.
It crawls under your eyelids
And spreads its webs there--

Are fastened
To the flesh and bones of you
As to rafters or grass.
 
There are filaments of your eyes
On the surface of the water
And in the edges of the snow.

I WAS asking for something specific and perfect for my city,
Whereupon, lo! upsprang the aboriginal name!
 
Now I see what there is in a name, a word, liquid, sane, unruly,
musical, self-sufficient;
I see that the word of my city is that word up there,
Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays, superb, with
tall and wonderful spires,
Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and steamships--an
island sixteen miles long, solid-founded,
Numberless crowded streets--high growths of iron, slender, strong,
light, splendidly uprising toward clear skies;
Tide swift and ample, well-loved by me, toward sundown,
The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger adjoining
islands, the heights, the villas,
The countless masts, the white shore-steamers, the lighters, the
ferry-boats, the black sea-steamers well-model'd;
 
The down-town streets, the jobbers' houses of business--the houses of
business of the ship-merchants, and money-brokers--the river-
streets;
Immigrants arriving, fifteen or twenty thousand in a week;
The carts hauling goods--the manly race of drivers of horses--the
brown-faced sailors;
The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds aloft;
The winter snows, the sleigh-bells--the broken ice in the river,
passing along, up or down, with the flood tide or ebb-tide;
The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form'd, beautiful-faced,
looking you straight in the eyes;
Trottoirs throng'd--vehicles--Broadway--the women--the shops and
shows,
The parades, processions, bugles playing, flags flying, drums
beating;
A million people--manners free and superb--open voices--hospitality--
the most courageous and friendly young men;
The free city! no slaves! no owners of slaves!
 
The beautiful city, the city of hurried and sparkling waters! the
city of spires and masts!
The city nested in bays! my city!
The city of such women, I am mad to be with them! I will return after
death to be with them!
The city of such young men, I swear I cannot live happy, without I
often go talk, walk, eat, drink, sleep, with them!

The Other Two
Sylvia Plath
All summer we moved in a villa brimful of echos,
Cool as the pearled interior of a conch.
Bells, hooves, of the high-stipping black goats woke us.
Around our bed the baronial furniture
Foundered through levels of light seagreen and strange.
Not one leaf wrinkled in the clearing air.
We dreamed how we were perfect, and we were.
 
Against bare, whitewashed walls, the furniture
Anchored itself, griffin-legged and darkly grained.
Two of us in a place meant for ten more-
Our footsteps multiplied in the shadowy chambers,
Our voices fathomed a profounder sound:
The walnut banquet table, the twelve chairs
Mirrored the intricate gestures of two others.
 
Heavy as a statuary, shapes not ours
Performed a dumbshow in the polished wood,
That cabinet without windows or doors:
He lifts an arm to bring her close, but she
Shies from his touch: his is an iron mood.
Seeing her freeze, he turns his face away.
They poise and grieve as in some old tragedy.
 
Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she
Would not be eased, released. Our each example
Of temderness dove through their purgatory
Like a planet, a stone, swallowed in a great darkness,
Leaving no sparky track, setting up no ripple.
Nightly we left them in their desert place.
Lights out, they dogged us, sleepless and envious:
 
We dreamed their arguments, their stricken voices.
We might embrace, but those two never did,
Come, so unlike us, to a stiff impasse,
Burdened in such a way we seemed the lighter-
Ourselves the haunters, and they, flesh and blood;
As if, above love's ruinage, we were
The heaven those two dreamed of, in despair.

I will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness,
For my surrounding air hath a new lightness;
Slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly
And left me cloaked as with a gauze of aether;
As with sweet leaves; as with subtle clearness.
Oh, I have picked up magic in her nearness
To sheathe me half in half the things that sheathe her.
No, no! Go from me. I have still the flavour,
Soft as spring wind that's come from birchen bowers.
Green come the shoots, aye April in the branches,
As winter's wound with her sleight hand she staunches,
Hath of the trees a likeness of the savour:
As white their bark, so white this lady's hours.

The Idea of Order at Key West
Wallace Stevens
She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind or voice,
Like a body wholly body, fluttering
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,
That was not ours although we understood,
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.
 
The sea was not a mask. No more was she.
The song and water were not medleyed sound
Even if what she sang was what she heard,
Since what she sang was uttered word by word.
It may be that in all her phrases stirred
The grinding water and the gasping wind;
But it was she and not the sea we heard.
 
For she was the maker of the song she sang.
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea
Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.
Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew
It was the spirit that we sought and knew
That we should ask this often as she sang.
 
If it was only the dark voice of the sea
That rose, or even colored by many waves;
If it was only the outer voice of sky
And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,
However clear, it would have been deep air,
The heaving speech of air, a summer sound
Repeated in a summer without end
And sound alone. But it was more than that,
More even than her voice, and ours, among
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres
Of sky and sea.
It was her voice that made
The sky acutest at its vanishing.
She measured to the hour its solitude.
She was the single artificer of the world
In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,
Whatever self it had, became the self
That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,
As we beheld her striding there alone,
Knew that there was never a world for her
Except the one she sang and, singing, made.
 
Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,
Why, when the singing ended and we turned
Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,
The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,
As the night descended, tilting in the air,

Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,
Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,
Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.
 
Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,
The maker's rage to order words of sea
Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,
And of ourselves and our origins,
In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.

I lie here thinking of you:---

smears with saffron
the horned branched the lean
heavily
against a smooth purple sky!

and limb to limb
spoiling the colors
of the whole world-
 
you far off there under
the wine-red selvage of the west!

Europe, The 72d And 73d Years Of These States
Walt Whitman
SUDDENLY, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,
Like lightning it le'pt forth, half startled at itself,
Its feet upon the ashes and the rags--its hands tight to the throats
of kings.
 
O hope and faith!
O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!
O many a sicken'd heart!
Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh.
 
And you, paid to defile the People! you liars, mark!
Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,
For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his
simplicity the poor man's wages, 
For many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laugh'd at in
the breaking,
Then in their power, not for all these, did the blows strike revenge,
or the heads of the nobles fall;
The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.
 
But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the
frighten'd monarchs come back;
Each comes in state, with his train--hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,
Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.
 
Yet behind all, lowering, stealing--lo, a Shape,
Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in
scarlet folds,
Whose face and eyes none may see,
Out of its robes only this--the red robes, lifted by the arm, 
One finger, crook'd, pointed high over the top, like the head of a
snake appears.
 
Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves--bloody corpses of young
men;
The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are
flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,
And all these things bear fruits--and they are good.
 
Those corpses of young men,
Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets--those hearts pierc'd by the
gray lead,
Cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere with unslaughter'd
vitality.
 
They live in other young men, O kings!
They live in brothers, again ready to defy you!
They were purified by death--they were taught and exalted. 

Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom, but grows seed for freedom,
in its turn to bear seed,
Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows
nourish.
 
Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,
But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling,
cautioning.
 
Liberty! let others despair of you! I never despair of you.
 
Is the house shut? Is the master away?
Nevertheless, be ready--be not weary of watching;
He will soon return--his messengers come anon.

The Dance
William Carlos Williams
In Breughel's great picture, The Kermess,
the dancers go round, they go round and
around, the squeal and the blare and the
tweedle of bagpipes, a bugle and fiddles
tipping their bellies, (round as the thick-
sided glasses whose wash they impound)
their hips and their bellies off balance
to turn them. Kicking and rolling about
the Fair Grounds, swinging their butts, those
shanks must be sound to bear up under such
rollicking measures, prance as they dance
in Breughel's great picture, The Kermess

The Blue Flag in the Bog
Edna St. Vincent Millay
God had called us, and we came;
Our loved Earth to ashes left;
Heaven was a neighbor's house,
Open flung to us, bereft.
 
Gay the lights of Heaven showed,
And 'twas God who walked ahead;
Yet I wept along the road,
Wanting my own house instead.
 
Wept unseen, unheeded cried,
""All you things my eyes have kissed,
Fare you well! We meet no more,
Lovely, lovely tattered mist!
 
Weary wings that rise and fall
All day long above the fire !""
Red with heat was every wall,
Rough with heat was every wire
 
""Fare you well, you little winds
That the flying embers chase!
Fare you well, you shuddering day,
With your hands before your face!
 
And, ah, blackened by strange blight,
Or to a false sun unfurled,
Now forevermore goodbye,
All the gardens in the world!
 
On the windless hills of Heaven,
That I have no wish to see,
 
White, eternal lilies stand,
By a lake of ebony.
 
But the Earth forevermore
Is a place where nothing grows,
Dawn will come, and no bud break;
Evening, and no blossom close.
 
Spring will come, and wander slow
Over an indifferent land,
Stand beside an empty creek,
Hold a dead seed in her hand.""
 
God had called us, and we came,
But the blessed road I trod
Was a bitter road to me,
And at heart I questioned God.
 
""Though in Heaven,"" I said, ""be all

That the heart would most desire,
Held Earth naught save souls of sinners
Worth the saving from a fire?
 
Withered grass,the wasted growing!
Aimless ache of laden boughs!""
Little things God had forgotten
Called me, from my burning house.
 
""Though in Heaven,"" I said, ""be all
That the eye could ask to see,
All the things I ever knew
Are this blaze in back of me.""
 
""Though in Heaven,"" I said, ""be all
That the ear could think to lack,
 
All the things I ever knew
Are this roaring at my back.""
 
It was God who walked ahead,
Like a shepherd to the fold;
In his footsteps fared the weak,
And the weary and the old,
 
Glad enough of gladness over,
Ready for the peace to be,
But a thing God had forgotten
Was the growing bones of me.
 
And I drew a bit apart,
And I lagged a bit behind,
And I thought on Peace Eternal,
Lest He look into my mind;
 
And I gazed upon the sky,
And I thought of Heavenly Rest,
And I slipped away like water
Through the fingers of the blest!
 
All their eyes were fixed on Glory,
Not a glance brushed over me;
""Alleluia ! Alleluia !""
Up the road,and I was free.
 
And my heart rose like a freshet,
And it swept me on before,
Giddy as a whirling stick,
Till I felt the earth once more.
 
All the Earth was charred and black,
Fire had swept from pole to pole;

And the bottom of the sea
Was as brittle as a bowl;
 
And the timbered mountain-top
Was as naked as a skull,
Nothing left, nothing left,
Of the Earth so beautiful!
 
""Earth,"" I said, ""how can I leave you?""
""You are all I have,"" I said;
""What is left to take my mind up,
Living always, and you dead?""
 
""Speak!"" I said, ""Oh, tell me something!
Make a sign that I can see!
For a keepsake! To keep always!
Quick! Before God misses me!""
 
And I listened for a voice;
But my heart was all I heard;
Not a screech-owl, not a loon,
Not a tree-toad said a word.
 
And I waited for a sign;
Coals and cinders, nothing more;
And a little cloud of smoke
Floating on a valley floor.
 
And I peered into the smoke
Till it rotted, like a fog:
There, encompassed round by fire,
Stood a blue-flag in a bog!
 
Little flames came wading out,
Straining, straining towards its stem,
 
But it was so blue and tall
That it scorned to think of them!
 
Red and thirsty were their tongues,
As the tongues of wolves must be,
But it was so blue and tall
Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!
 
All my heart became a tear,
All my soul became a tower,
Never loved I anything
As I loved that tall blue flower!
 
It was all the little boats
That had ever sailed the sea,

It was all the little books
That had gone to school with me;
 
On its roots like iron claws
Rearing up so blue and tall,
It was all the gallant Earth
With its back against a wall!
 
In a breath, ere I had breathed,
Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!
I was kneeling at its side,
And it leaned its head on me!
 
Crumbling stones and sliding sand
Is the road to Heaven now;
Icy at my straining knees
Drags the awful under-tow;
 
Soon but stepping-stones of dust
Will the road to Heaven be,
 
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Reach a hand and rescue me!
 
""Therethere, my blue-flag flower;
Hushhushgo to sleep;
That is only God you hear,
Counting up His folded sheep!
 
Lullabyelullabye
That is only God that calls,
Missing me, seeking me,
Ere the road to nothing falls!
 
He will set His mighty feet
Firmly on the sliding sand;
Like a little frightened bird
I will creep into His hand;
 
I will tell Him all my grief,
I will tell Him all my sin;
He will give me half His robe
For a cloak to wrap you in.
 
Lullabyelullabye""
Rocks the burnt-out planet free!
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Reach a hand and rescue me!
 
Ah, the voice of love at last !
Lo, at last the face of light !
And the whole of His white robe

For a cloak against the night!
 
And upon my heart asleep
All the things I ever knew!
 
""Holds Heaven not some cranny, Lord,
For a flower so tall and blue?""
 
All's well and all's well!
Gay the lights of Heaven show!
In some moist and Heavenly place
We will set it out to grow.

Old man, you surface seldom.
Then you come in with the tide's coming
When seas wash cold, foam-
 
Capped: white hair, white beard, far-flung,
A dragnet, rising, falling, as waves
Crest and trough. Miles long
 
Extend the radial sheaves
Of your spread hair, in which wrinkling skeins
Knotted, caught, survives
 
The old myth of orgins
Unimaginable. You float near
As kneeled ice-mountains
 
Of the north, to be steered clear
Of, not fathomed. All obscurity
Starts with a danger:
 
Your dangers are many. I
Cannot look much but your form suffers
Some strange injury
 
And seems to die: so vapors
Ravel to clearness on the dawn sea.
The muddy rumors
 
Of your burial move me
To half-believe: your reappearance
Proves rumors shallow,
 
For the archaic trenched lines
Of your grained face shed time in runnels:
Ages beat like rains
 
On the unbeaten channels
Of the ocean. Such sage humor and
Durance are whirlpools
 
To make away with the ground-
Work of the earth and the sky's ridgepole.
Waist down, you may wind
 
One labyrinthine tangle
To root deep among knuckles, shinbones,
Skulls. Inscrutable,
 
Below shoulders not once
Seen by any man who kept his head,
You defy questions;

You defy godhood.
I walk dry on your kingdom's border
Exiled to no good.
 
Your shelled bed I remember.
Father, this thick air is murderous.
I would breathe water.

""Vocat aestus in umbram""
Nemesianus Es. IV.
 
E. P. Ode pour l'élection de son sépulchre
 
For three years, out of key with his time,
He strove to resuscitate the dead art
Of poetry; to maintain ""the sublime""
In the old sense. Wrong from the start --
 
No, hardly, but, seeing he had been born
In a half savage country, out of date;
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
Capaneus; trout for factitious bait:
 
""Idmen gar toi panth, os eni Troie
Caught in the unstopped ear;
Giving the rocks small lee-way
The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.
 
His true Penelope was Flaubert,
He fished by obstinate isles;
Observed the elegance of Circe's hair
Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.
 
Unaffected by ""the march of events"",
He passed from men's memory in l'an trentiesme
De son eage; the case presents
No adjunct to the Muses' diadem.
 
II.
 
The age demanded an image
Of its accelerated grimace,
Something for the modern stage,
Not, at any rate, an Attic grace;
 
Not, not certainly, the obscure reveries
Of the inward gaze;
Better mendacities
Than the classics in paraphrase!
 
The ""age demanded"" chiefly a mould in plaster,
Made with no loss of time,
A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster
Or the ""sculpture"" of rhyme.

The tea-rose, tea-gown, etc.
Supplants the mousseline of Cos,
The pianola ""replaces""

Christ follows Dionysus,
Phallic and ambrosial
Made way for macerations;
Caliban casts out Ariel.
 
All things are a flowing,
Sage Heracleitus says;
But a tawdry cheapness
Shall reign throughout our days.
 
Even the Christian beauty
Defects -- after Samothrace;
We see to kalon
Decreed in the market place.
 
Faun's flesh is not to us,
Nor the saint's vision.
We have the press for wafer;
Franchise for circumcision.
 
All men, in law, are equals.
Free of Peisistratus,
We choose a knave or an eunuch
To rule over us.
 
A bright Apollo,
 
tin andra, tin eroa, tina theon,
What god, man, or hero
Shall I place a tin wreath upon?

believing in old men's lies, then unbelieving

Daring as never before, wastage as never before.
Young blood and high blood,
Fair cheeks, and fine bodies;

disillusions as never told in the old days,
hysterias, trench confessions,

There died a myriad,
And of the best, among them,
For an old bitch gone in the teeth,
For a botched civilization.

For a few thousand battered books.

Painters and adulterers.
 
The Burne-Jones cartons
Have preserved her eyes;
Still, at the Tate, they teach
Cophetua to rhapsodize;
 
Thin like brook-water,
With a vacant gaze.
The English Rubaiyat was still-born
In those days.

The thin, clear gaze, the same
Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face,
Questing and passive ....
""Ah, poor Jenny's case"" ...
 
Bewildered that a world
Shows no surprise
At her last maquero's
Adulteries.
 
""Siena Mi Fe', Disfecemi Maremma""
 
Among the pickled fœtuses and bottled bones,
Engaged in perfecting the catalogue,
I found the last scion of the
Senatorial families of Strasbourg, Monsieur Verog.
 
For two hours he talked of Gallifet;
Of Dowson; of the Rhymers' Club;
Told me how Johnson (Lionel) died
By falling from a high stool in a pub ...
 
But showed no trace of alcohol
At the autopsy, privately performed --
Tissue preserved -- the pure mind
Arose toward Newman as the whiskey warmed.
 
Dowson found harlots cheaper than hotels;
Headlam for uplift; Image impartially imbued
With raptures for Bacchus, Terpsichore and the Church.
So spoke the author of ""The Dorian Mood"",
 
M. Verog, out of step with the decade,
Detached from his contemporaries,
Neglected by the young,
Because of these reveries.
 
Brennbaum.
 
The sky-like limpid eyes,
The circular infant's face,
The stiffness from spats to collar
Never relaxing into grace;
 
The heavy memories of Horeb, Sinai and the forty years,
Showed only when the daylight fell
Level across the face
Of Brennbaum ""The Impeccable"".

Mr. Nixon advised me kindly, to advance with fewer
Dangers of delay. ""Consider

Beneath the sagging roof
The stylist has taken shelter,
Unpaid, uncelebrated,
At last from the world's welter
 
Nature receives him,

And the soil meets his distress.

Leaks through its thatch;
He offers succulent cooking;
The door has a creaking latch.

Of precisely the fashion
To stimulate, in her,
A durable passion;
 
Doubtful, somewhat, of the value
Of well-gowned approbation
Of literary effort,
But never of The Lady Valentine's vocation:
 
Poetry, her border of ideas,
The edge, uncertain, but a means of blending
With other strata
Where the lower and higher have ending;
 
A hook to catch the Lady Jane's attention,
A modulation toward the theatre,
Also, in the case of revolution,
A possible friend and comforter.

Squatter's Children
Elizabeth Bishop
On the unbreathing sides of hills
they play, a specklike girl and boy,
alone, but near a specklike house.
The Sun's suspended eye
blinks casually, and then they wade
gigantic waves of light and shade.
A dancing yellow spot, a pup,
attends them. Clouds are piling up;
 
a storm piles up behind the house.
The children play at digging holes.
The ground is hard; they try to use
one of their father's tools,
a mattock with a broken haft
the two of them can scarcely lift.
It drops and clangs. Their laughter spreads
effulgence in the thunderheads,
 
Weak flashes of inquiry
direct as is the puppy's bark.
But to their little, soluble,
unwarrantable ark,
apparently the rain's reply
consists of echolalia,
and Mother's voice, ugly as sin,
keeps calling to them to come in.
 
Children, the threshold of the storm
has slid beneath your muddy shoes;
wet and beguiled, you stand among
the mansions you may choose
out of a bigger house than yours,
whose lawfulness endures.
It's soggy documents retain
your rights in rooms of falling rain.

Vespers
Louise Gluck
In your extended absence, you permit me
use of earth, anticipating
some return on investment. I must report
failure in my assignment, principally
regarding the tomato plants.
I think I should not be encouraged to grow
tomatoes. Or, if I am, you should withhold
the heavy rains, the cold nights that come
so often here, while other regions get
twelve weeks of summer. All this
belongs to you: on the other hand,
I planted the seeds, I watched the first shoots
like wings tearing the soil, and it was my heart
broken by the blight, the black spot so quickly
multiplying in the rows. I doubt
you have a heart, in our understanding of
that term. You who do not discriminate
between the dead and the living, who are, in consequence,
immune to foreshadowing, you may not know
how much terror we bear, the spotted leaf,
the red leaves of the maple falling
even in August, in early darkness: I am responsible
for these vines.

The stitches stopped--by themselves--
And then 'twas put among the Dust

Morning Song

Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry
Took its place among the elements.
 
Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.
In a drafty museum, your nakedness
Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.
 
I'm no more your mother
Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
Effacement at the wind's hand.
 
All night your moth-breath
Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:
A far sea moves in my ear.
 
One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
In my Victorian nightgown.
Your mouth opens clean as a cat's. The window square
 
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try
Your handful of notes;
The clear vowels rise like balloons.

Of little leaves opening stickily.

The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
The spikes of the crocus.
The smell of the earth is good.
It is apparent that there is no death.
But what does that signify?
Not only under ground are the brains of men
Eaten by maggots.
Life in itself
Is nothing,
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,
April
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.

Mystic
Sylvia Plath
The air is a mill of hooks --
Questions without answer,
Glittering and drunk as flies
Whose kiss stings unbearably
In the fetid wombs of black air under pines in summer.
 
I remember
The dead smell of sun on wood cabins,
The stiffness of sails, the long salt winding sheets.
Once one has seen God, what is the remedy?
Once one has been seized up
 
Without a part left over,
Not a toe, not a finger, and used,
Used utterly, in the sun's conflagration, the stains
That lengthen from ancient cathedrals
What is the remedy?
 
The pill of the Communion tablet,
The walking beside still water? Memory?
Or picking up the bright pieces
Of Christ in the faces of rodents,
The tame flower-nibblers, the ones
 
Whose hopes are so low they are comfortable --
The humpback in his small, washed cottage
Under the spokes of the clematis.
Is there no great love, only tenderness?
Does the sea
 
Remember the walker upon it?
Meaning leaks from the molecules.
The chimneys of the city breathe, the window sweats,
The children leap in their cots.
The sun blooms, it is a geranium.
 
The heart has not stopped.

Canto XLIX: For the Seven Lakes
Ezra Pound
For the seven lakes, and by no man these verses:
Rain; empty river; a voyage,
Fire from frozen cloud, heavy rain in the twilight
Under the cabin roof was one lantern.
The reeds are heavy; bent;
and the bamboos speak as if weeping.
 
Autumn moon; hills rise about lakes
against sunset
Evening is like a curtain of cloud,
a blurr above ripples; and through it
sharp long spikes of the cinnamon,
a cold tune amid reeds.
Behind hill the monk's bell
borne on the wind.
Sail passed here in April; may return in October
Boat fades in silver; slowly;
Sun blaze alone on the river.
 
Where wine flag catches the sunset
Sparse chimneys smoke in the cross light
 
Comes then snow scur on the river
And a world is covered with jade
Small boat floats like a lanthorn,
The flowing water closts as with cold. And at San Yin
they are a people of leisure.
 
Wild geese swoop to the sand-bar,
Clouds gather about the hole of the window
Broad water; geese line out with the autumn
Rooks clatter over the fishermen's lanthorns,
 
A light moves on the north sky line;
where the young boys prod stones for shrimp.
In seventeen hundred came Tsing to these hill lakes.
A light moves on the South sky line.

What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, And Where, And Why (Sonnet XLIII)

What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain
Under my head till morning; but the rain
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh
Upon the glass and listen for reply,
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain
For unremembered lads that not again
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.
Thus in winter stands the lonely tree,
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:
I cannot say what loves have come and gone,
I only know that summer sang in me
A little while, that in me sings no more.

To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff!

But never knew I this;

Seascape

This celestial seascape, with white herons got up as angels,
flying high as they want and as far as they want sidewise
in tiers and tiers of immaculate reflections;
the whole region, from the highest heron
down to the weightless mangrove island
with bright green leaves edged neatly with bird-droppings
like illumination in silver,
and down to the suggestively Gothic arches of the mangrove roots
and the beautiful pea-green back-pasture
where occasionally a fish jumps, like a wildflower
in an ornamental spray of spray;
this cartoon by Raphael for a tapestry for a Pope:
it does look like heaven.
But a skeletal lighthouse standing there
in black and white clerical dress,
who lives on his nerves, thinks he knows better.
He thinks that hell rages below his iron feet,
that that is why the shallow water is so warm,
and he knows that heaven is not like this.
Heaven is not like flying or swimming,
but has something to do with blackness and a strong glare
and when it gets dark he will remember something
strongly worded to say on the subject.

There is this white wall, above which the sky creates itself-
Infinite, green, utterly untouchable.
Angels swim in it, and the stars, in indifference also.
They are my medium.
The sun dissolves on this wall, bleeding its lights.
 
A grey wall now, clawed and bloody.
Is there no way out of the mind?
Steps at my back spiral into a well.
There are no trees or birds in this world,
There is only sourness.
 
This red wall winces continually:
A red fist, opening and closing,
Two grey, papery bags-
This is what i am made of, this, and a terror
Of being wheeled off under crosses and rain of pieties.
 
On a black wall, unidentifiable birds
Swivel their heads and cry.
There is no talk of immorality amoun these!
Cold blanks approach us:
They move in a hurry.

All overgrown by cunning moss,

The little cage of ""Currer Bell""
In quiet ""Haworth"" laid.

""Hope"" is the thing with feathers—
That perches in the soul—

And never stops—at all—
 
And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—
And sore must be the storm—
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm—
 
I've heard it in the chillest land—
And on the strangest Sea—
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb—of Me.

Cinderella
Sylvia Plath
The prince leans to the girl in scarlet heels,
Her green eyes slant, hair flaring in a fan
Of silver as the rondo slows; now reels
Begin on tilted violins to span
 
The whole revolving tall glass palace hall
Where guests slide gliding into light like wine;
Rose candles flicker on the lilac wall
Reflecting in a million flagons' shine,
 
And glided couples all in whirling trance
Follow holiday revel begun long since,
Until near twelve the strange girl all at once
Guilt-stricken halts, pales, clings to the prince
 
As amid the hectic music and cocktail talk
She hears the caustic ticking of the clock.

Anne Sexton
My God, my God, what queer corner am I in?
Didn't I die, blood running down the post,
lungs gagging for air, die there for the sin
of anyone, my sour mouth giving up the ghost?
Surely my body is done? Surely I died?
And yet, I know, I'm here. What place is this?
Cold and queer, I sting with life. I lied.
Yes, I lied. Or else in some damned cowardice
my body would not give me up. I touch
fine cloth with my hand and my cheeks are cold.
If this is hell, then hell could not be much,
neither as special or as ugly as I was told.

One Art
Elizabeth Bishop
The art of losing isn't hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster,
 
Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
 
Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.
 
I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three beloved houses went.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
 
I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.
 
-- Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident
the art of losing's not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!) a disaster.

A Visit To The Asylum
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Once from a big, big building,
When I was small, small,
The queer folk in the windows
Would smile at me and call.
 
And in the hard wee gardens
Such pleasant men would hoe:
""Sir, may we touch the little girl's hair!""--
It was so red, you know.
 
They cut me coloured asters
With shears so sharp and neat,
They brought me grapes and plums and pears
And pretty cakes to eat.
 
And out of all the windows,
No matter where we went,
The merriest eyes would follow me
And make me compliment.
 
There were a thousand windows,
All latticed up and down.
And up to all the windows,
When we went back to town,
 
The queer folk put their faces,
As gentle as could be;
""Come again, little girl!"" they called, and I
Called back, ""You come see me!""

Louise Gluck
I became a criminal when I fell in love.
Before that I was a waitress.
 
I didn't want to go to Chicago with you.
I wanted to marry you, I wanted
Your wife to suffer.
 
I wanted her life to be like a play
In which all the parts are sad parts.
 
Does a good person
Think this way? I deserve
 
Credit for my courage--
 
I sat in the dark on your front porch.
Everything was clear to me:
If your wife wouldn't let you go
That proved she didn't love you.
If she loved you
Wouldn't she want you to be happy?
 
I think now
If I felt less I would be
A better person. I was
A good waitress.
I could carry eight drinks.
 
I used to tell you my dreams.
Last night I saw a woman sitting in a dark bus--
In the dream, she's weeping, the bus she's on
Is moving away. With one hand
She's waving; the other strokes
An egg carton full of babies.
 
The dream doesn't rescue the maiden.

There is always something to be made of pain.

She turns out scarves in every shade of red.
They were for Christmas, and they kept you warm

No wonder you are the way you are,
afraid of blood, your women

Days that cannot bring you near

Distance trying to appear
something more obstinate,
argue argue argue with me
endlessly
neither proving you less wanted nor less dear.
 
Distance: Remember all that land
beneath the plane;
that coastline
of dim beaches deep in sand
stretching indistinguishably
all the way,
all the way to where my reasons end?
 
Days: And think
of all those cluttered instruments,
one to a fact,
canceling each other's experience;
how they were
like some hideous calendar

of these voices
we must separately find

The Bight
Elizabeth Bishop
At low tide like this how sheer the water is.
White, crumbling ribs of marl protrude and glare
and the boats are dry, the pilings dry as matches.
Absorbing, rather than being absorbed,
the water in the bight doesn't wet anything,
the color of the gas flame turned as low as possible.
One can smell it turning to gas; if one were Baudelaire
one could probably hear it turning to marimba music.
The little ocher dredge at work off the end of the dock
already plays the dry perfectly off-beat claves.
The birds are outsize. Pelicans crash
into this peculiar gas unnecessarily hard,
it seems to me, like pickaxes,
rarely coming up with anything to show for it,
and going off with humorous elbowings.
Black-and-white man-of-war birds soar
on impalpable drafts
and open their tails like scissors on the curves
or tense them like wishbones, till they tremble.
The frowsy sponge boats keep coming in
with the obliging air of retrievers,
bristling with jackstraw gaffs and hooks
and decorated with bobbles of sponges.
There is a fence of chicken wire along the dock
where, glinting like little plowshares,
the blue-gray shark tails are hung up to dry
for the Chinese-restaurant trade.
Some of the little white boats are still piled up
against each other, or lie on their sides, stove in,
and not yet salvaged, if they ever will be, from the last bad storm,
like torn-open, unanswered letters.
The bight is littered with old correspondences.
Click. Click. Goes the dredge,
and brings up a dripping jawful of marl.
All the untidy activity continues,
awful but cheerful.

Modern Declaration

I, having loved ever since I was a child a few things, never having
wavered
In these affections; never through shyness in the houses of the
rich or in the presence of clergymen having denied these
loves;
Never when worked upon by cynics like chiropractors having
grunted or clicked a vertebra to the discredit of those loves;
Never when anxious to land a job having diminished them by a
conniving smile; or when befuddled by drink
Jeered at them through heartache or lazily fondled the fingers of
their alert enemies; declare
 
That I shall love you always.
No matter what party is in power;
No matter what temporarily expedient combination of allied
interests wins the war;
Shall love you always.

A Goodnight
William Carlos Williams
Go to sleep--though of course you will not--
to tideless waves thundering slantwise against
strong embankments, rattle and swish of spray
dashed thirty feet high, caught by the lake wind,
scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady
car rails! Sleep, sleep! Gulls' cries in a wind-gust
broken by the wind; calculating wings set above
the field of waves breaking.
Go to sleep to the lunge between foam-crests,
refuse churned in the recoil. Food! Food!
Offal! Offal! that holds them in the air, wave-white
for the one purpose, feather upon feather, the wild
chill in their eyes, the hoarseness in their voices--
sleep, sleep ...
 
Gentlefooted crowds are treading out your lullaby.
Their arms nudge, they brush shoulders,
hitch this way then that, mass and surge at the crossings--
lullaby, lullaby! The wild-fowl police whistles,
the enraged roar of the traffic, machine shrieks:
it is all to put you to sleep,
to soften your limbs in relaxed postures,
and that your head slip sidewise, and your hair loosen
and fall over your eyes and over your mouth,
brushing your lips wistfully that you may dream,
sleep and dream--
 
A black fungus springs out about the lonely church doors--
sleep, sleep. The Night, coming down upon
the wet boulevard, would start you awake with his
message, to have in at your window. Pay no
heed to him. He storms at your sill with
cooings, with gesticulations, curses!
You will not let him in. He would keep you from sleeping.
He would have you sit under your desk lamp
brooding, pondering; he would have you
slide out the drawer, take up the ornamented dagger
and handle it. It is late, it is nineteen-nineteen--
go to sleep, his cries are a lullaby;
his jabbering is a sleep-well-my-baby; he is
a crackbrained messenger.
 
The maid waking you in the morning
when you are up and dressing,
the rustle of your clothes as you raise them--
it is the same tune.
At table the cold, greeninsh, split grapefruit, its juice
on the tongue, the clink of the spoon in
your coffee, the toast odors say it over and over.
 
The open street-door lets in the breath of
the morning wind from over the lake.

The bus coming to a halt grinds from its sullen brakes--
lullaby, lullaby. The crackle of a newspaper,
the movement of the troubled coat beside you--
sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep ...
It is the sting of snow, the burning liquor of
the moonlight, the rush of rain in the gutters packed
with dead leaves: go to sleep, go to sleep.
And the night passes--and never passes--

Berck-Plage
Sylvia Plath

This is the sea, then, this great abeyance.
How the sun's poultice draws on my inflammation.
 
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the freeze
By pale girls, travel the air in scorched hands.
 
Why is it so quiet, what are they hiding?
I have two legs, and I move smilingly..
 
A sandy damper kills the vibrations;
It stretches for miles, the shrunk voices
 
Waving and crutchless, half their old size.
The lines of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
 
Boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner.
Is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses?
 
Is it any wonder he affects a black cassock?
Here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers
 
Who wall up their backs against him.
They are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts of a body.
 
The sea, that crystallized these,
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a long hiss of distress.
 
(2)
 
This black boot has no mercy for anybody.
Why should it, it is the hearse of a dad foot,
 
The high, dead, toeless foot of this priest
Who plumbs the well of his book,
 
The bent print bulging before him like scenery.
Obscene bikinis hid in the dunes,
 
Breasts and hips a confectioner's sugar
Of little crystals, titillating the light,
 
While a green pool opens its eye,
Sick with what it has swallowed----
 
Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the concrete bunkers
Two lovers unstick themselves.
 
O white sea-crockery,
What cupped sighs, what salt in the throat....

And the onlooker, trembling,
Drawn like a long material
 
Through a still virulence,
And a weed, hairy as privates.
 
(3)
 
On the balconies of the hotel, things are glittering.
Things, things----
 
Tubular steel wheelchairs, aluminum crutches.
Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk
 
Beyond the breakwater, spotty with barnacles?
I am not a nurse, white and attendant,
 
I am not a smile.
These children are after something, with hooks and cries,
 
And my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults.
This is the side of a man: his red ribs,
 
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon:
One mirrory eye----
 
A facet of knowledge.
On a striped mattress in one room
 
An old man is vanishing.
There is no help in his weeping wife.
 
Where are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,
And the tongue, sapphire of ash.
 
(4)
 
A wedding-cake face in a paper frill.
How superior he is now.
 
It is like possessing a saint.
The nurses in their wing-caps are no longer so beautiful;
 
They are browning, like touched gardenias.
The bed is rolled from the wall.
 
This is what it is to be complete. It is horrible.
Is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit

Under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak
Rises so whitely unbuffeted?
 
They propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened
And folded his hands, that were shaking: goodbye, goodbye.
 
Now the washed sheets fly in the sun,
The pillow cases are sweetening.
 
It is a blessing, it is a blessing:
The long coffin of soap-colored oak,
 
The curious bearers and the raw date
Engraving itself in silver with marvelous calm.
 
(5)
 
The gray sky lowers, the hills like a green sea
Run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows,
 
The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife----
Blunt, practical boats
 
Full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters.
In the parlor of the stone house
 
One curtain is flickering from the open window,
Flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle.
 
This is the tongue of the dead man: remember, remember.
How far he is now, his actions
 
Around him like living room furniture, like a décor.
As the pallors gather----
 
The pallors of hands and neighborly faces,
The elate pallors of flying iris.
 
They are flying off into nothing: remember us.
The empty benches of memory look over stones,
 
Marble facades with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
It is so beautiful up here: it is a stopping place.
 
(6)
 
The natural fatness of these lime leaves!----
Pollarded green balls, the trees march to church.
 
The voice of the priest, in thin air,

Meets the corpse at the gate,
 
Addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell;
A glittler of wheat and crude earth.
 
What is the name of that color?----
Old blood of caked walls the sun heals,
 
Old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts.
The widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters,
 
Necessary among the flowers,
Enfolds her lace like fine linen,
 
Not to be spread again.
While a sky, wormy with put-by smiles,
 
Passes cloud after cloud.
And the bride flowers expend a freshness,
 
And the soul is a bride
In a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless.
 
(7)
 
Behind the glass of this car
The world purrs, shut-off and gentle.
 
And I am dark-suited and still, a member of the party,
Gliding up in low gear behind the cart.
 
And the priest is a vessel,
A tarred fabric, sorry and dull,
 
Following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman,
A crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
 
Storming the hilltop.
Then, from the barred yard, the children
 
Smell the melt of shoe-blacking,
Their faces turning, wordless and slow,
 
Their eyes opening
On a wonderful thing----
 
Six round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood,
And a naked mouth, red and awkward.
 
For a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma.
There is no hope, it is given up.

The Sense Of The Sleight-Of-Hand Man
Wallace Stevens
One's grand flights, one's Sunday baths,
One's tootings at the weddings of the soul
Occur as they occur. So bluish clouds
Occurred above the empty house and the leaves
Of the rhododendrons rattled their gold,
As if someone lived there. Such floods of white
Came bursting from the clouds. So the wind
Threw its contorted strength around the sky.
 
Could you have said the bluejay suddenly
Would swoop to earth? It is a wheel, the rays
Around the sun. The wheel survives the myths.
The fire eye in the clouds survives the gods.
To think of a dove with an eye of grenadine
And pines that are cornets, so it occurs,
And a little island full of geese and stars:
It may be the ignorant man, alone,
Has any chance to mate his life with life
That is the sensual, pearly spuse, the life
That is fluent in even the wintriest bronze.

And you never see her chimney smoke
Til past ten o'clock!

By the light of the moon,

American Feuillage
Walt Whitman
AMERICA always!
Always our own feuillage!
Always Florida's green peninsula! Always the priceless delta of
Louisiana! Always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas!
Always California's golden hills and hollows--and the silver
mountains of New Mexico! Always soft-breath'd Cuba!
Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern Sea--inseparable with
the slopes drain'd by the Eastern and Western Seas;
The area the eighty-third year of These States--the three and a half
millions of square miles;
The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the main--
the thirty thousand miles of river navigation,
The seven millions of distinct families, and the same number of
dwellings--Always these, and more, branching forth into
numberless branches;
Always the free range and diversity! always the continent of
Democracy!
Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers,
Kanada, the snows; 
Always these compact lands--lands tied at the hips with the belt
stringing the huge oval lakes;
Always the West, with strong native persons--the increasing density
there--the habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning
invaders;
All sights, South, North, East--all deeds, promiscuously done at all
times,
All characters, movements, growths--a few noticed, myriads unnoticed,
Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering;
On interior rivers, by night, in the glare of pine knots, steamboats
wooding up;
Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys
of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke
and Delaware;
In their northerly wilds, beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks,
the hills--or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink;
In a lonesome inlet, a sheldrake, lost from the flock, sitting on the
water, rocking silently;
In farmers' barns, oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done--they
rest standing--they are too tired; 
Afar on arctic ice, the she-walrus lying drowsily, while her cubs
play around;
The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd--the farthest polar
sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes;
White drift spooning ahead, where the ship in the tempest dashes;
On solid land, what is done in cities, as the bells all strike
midnight together;
In primitive woods, the sounds there also sounding--the howl of the
wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the
elk;
In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead Lake--in summer
visible through the clear waters, the great trout swimming;

In lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas, the large black
buzzard floating slowly, high beyond the tree tops,
Below, the red cedar, festoon'd with tylandria--the pines and
cypresses, growing out of the white sand that spreads far and
flat;
Rude boats descending the big Pedee--climbing plants, parasites, with
color'd flowers and berries, enveloping huge trees,
The waving drapery on the live oak, trailing long and low,
noiselessly waved by the wind; 
The camp of Georgia wagoners, just after dark--the supper-fires, and
the cooking and eating by whites and negroes,
Thirty or forty great wagons--the mules, cattle, horses, feeding from
troughs,
The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees--
the flames--with the black smoke from the pitch-pine, curling
and rising;
Southern fishermen fishing--the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's
coast--the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery--the large
sweep-seines--the windlasses on shore work'd by horses--the
clearing, curing, and packing-houses;
Deep in the forest, in piney woods, turpentine dropping from the
incisions in the trees--There are the turpentine works,
There are the negroes at work, in good health--the ground in all
directions is cover'd with pine straw:
--In Tennessee and Kentucky, slaves busy in the coalings, at the
forge, by the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking;
In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence,
joyfully welcom'd and kiss'd by the aged mulatto nurse;
On rivers, boatmen safely moor'd at night-fall, in their boats, under
shelter of high banks,
Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle--
others sit on the gunwale, smoking and talking; 
Late in the afternoon, the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing
in the Great Dismal Swamp--there are the greenish waters, the
resinous odor, the plenteous moss, the cypress tree, and the
juniper tree;
--Northward, young men of Mannahatta--the target company from an
excursion returning home at evening--the musket-muzzles all
bear bunches of flowers presented by women;
Children at play--or on his father's lap a young boy fallen asleep,
(how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)
The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the
Mississippi--he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eye around;
California life--the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume--the
stanch California friendship--the sweet air--the graves one, in
passing, meets, solitary, just aside the horsepath;
Down in Texas, the cotton-field, the negro-cabins--drivers driving
mules or oxen before rude carts--cotton bales piled on banks
and wharves;
Encircling all, vast-darting, up and wide, the American Soul, with
equal hemispheres--one Love, one Dilation or Pride;
--In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, the aborigines--the

calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and indorsement,
The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward the
earth,
The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural
exclamations, 
The setting out of the war-party--the long and stealthy march,
The single-file--the swinging hatchets--the surprise and slaughter of
enemies;
--All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of These States--
reminiscences, all institutions,
All These States, compact--Every square mile of These States, without
excepting a particle--you also--me also,
Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields,
Me, observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies,
shuffling between each other, ascending high in the air;
The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects--the fall traveler
southward, but returning northward early in the spring;
The country boy at the close of the day, driving the herd of cows,
and shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the road-side;
The city wharf--Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New
Orleans, San Francisco,
The departing ships, when the sailors heave at the capstan; 
--Evening--me in my room--the setting sun,
The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the swarm
of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre of the
room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows in
specks on the opposite wall, where the shine is;
The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of
listeners;
Males, females, immigrants, combinations--the copiousness--the
individuality of The States, each for itself--the money-makers;
Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces--the windlass, lever,
pulley--All certainties,
The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity,
In space, the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars--on the firm
earth, the lands, my lands;
O lands! all so dear to me--what you are, (whatever it is,) I become
a part of that, whatever it is;
Southward there, I screaming, with wings slowly flapping, with the
myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida--or in
Louisiana, with pelicans breeding;
Otherways, there, atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande,
the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the
Saskatchawan, or the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing
and skipping and running; 
Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I, with
parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and
aquatic plants;
Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the
crow with its bill, for amusement--And I triumphantly
twittering;
The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh

themselves--the body of the flock feed--the sentinels outside
move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to
time reliev'd by other sentinels--And I feeding and taking
turns with the rest;
In Kanadian forests, the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters,
rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his
fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--And I, plunging at the
hunters, corner'd and desperate;
In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the
countless workmen working in the shops,
And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself
than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,
Singing the song of These, my ever united lands--my body no more
inevitably united, part to part, and made one identity, any
more than my lands are inevitably united, and made ONE
IDENTITY;
Nativities, climates, the grass of the great Pastoral Plains;
Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil--these
me,
These affording, in all their particulars, endless feuillage to me
and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the
union of them, to afford the like to you? 
Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also
be eligible as I am?
How can I but, as here, chanting, invite you for yourself to collect
bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of These States?

Lament of the Frontier Guard
Ezra Pound
By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand,
Lonely from the beginning of time until now!
Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn.
I climb the towers and towers
to watch out the barbarous land:
Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert.
There is no wall left to this village.
Bones white with a thousand frosts,
High heaps, covered with trees and grass;
Who brought this to pass?
Who has brought the flaming imperial anger?
Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums?
Barbarous kings.
A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn,
A turmoil of wars - men, spread over the middle kingdom,
Three hundred and sixty thousand,
And sorrow, sorrow like rain.
Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning,
Desolate, desolate fields,
And no children of warfare upon them,
No longer the men for offence and defence.
Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the North Gate,
With Rihoku's name forgotten,
And we guardsmen fed to the tigers.

Rode across the hills and broke them--

And danced all the modern dances;
And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,
But they knew that it was modern.

The army of unalterable law.

O Captain! My Captain!
Walt Whitman
O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:
But O heart! heart! heart!
O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.
 
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills; 
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
Here Captain! dear father!
This arm beneath your head;
It is some dream that on the deck,
You've fallen cold and dead.
 
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won; 
Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!
But I, with mournful tread,
Walk the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.

The Inventory of Goodbye
Anne Sexton
I have a pack of letters,
I have a pack of memories.
I could cut out the eyes of both.
I could wear them like a patchwork apron.
I could stick them in the washer, the drier,
and maybe some of the pain would float off like dirt?
Perhaps down the disposal I could grind up the loss.
Besides - what a bargain - no expensive phone calls.
No lengthy trips on planes in the fog.
No manicky laughter or blessing from an odd-lot priest.
That priest is probably still floating on a fog pillow.
Blessing us. Blessing us.
 
Am I to bless the lost you,
sitting here with my clumsy soul?
Propaganda time is over.
I sit here on the spike of truth.
No one to hate except the slim fish of memory
that slides in and out of my brain.
No one to hate except the acute feel of my nightgown
brushing my body like a light that has gone out.
It recalls the kiss we invented, tongues like poems,
meeting, returning, inviting, causing a fever of need.
Laughter, maps, cassettes, touch singing its path -
all to be broken and laid away in a tight strongbox.
The monotonous dead clog me up and there is only
black done in black that oozes from the strongbox.
I must disembowel it and then set the heart, the legs,
of two who were one upon a large woodpile
and ignite, as I was once ignited, and let it whirl
into flame, reaching the sky
making it dangerous with its red.

Velocity of Money
Allen Ginsberg
I'm delighted by the velocity of money as it whistles through the windows
of Lower East Side
Delighted by skyscrapers rising the old grungy apartments falling on
84th Street
Delighted by inflation that drives me out on the street
After all what good's the family farm, why eat turkey by thousands every
Thanksgiving?
Why not have Star Wars? Why have the same old America?!?
George Washington wasn't good enough! Tom Paine pain in the neck,
Whitman what a jerk!
I'm delighted by double digit interest rates in the Capitalist world
I always was a communist, now we'll win
an usury makes the walls thinner, books thicker & dumber
Usury makes my poetry more valuable
my manuscripts worth their weight in useless gold -
Now everybody's atheist like me, nothing's sacred
buy and sell your grandmother, eat up old age homes,
Peddle babies on the street, pretty boys for sale on Times Square -
You can shoot heroin, I can sniff cocaine,
macho men can fite on the Nicaraguan border and get paid with paper!
The velocity's what counts as the National Debt gets higher
Everybody running after the rising dollar
Crowds of joggers down broadway past City Hall on the way to the Fed
Nobody reads Dostoyevsky books so they'll have to give a passing ear
to my fragmented ravings in between President's speeches
Nothing's happening but the collapse of the Economy
so I can go back to sleep till the landlord wins his eviction suit in court.

Slim inquirer, while the old fathers sleep
you are reworking their soil, you have
a grocery store there down under the earth
and it is well stocked with broken wine bottles,
old cigars, old door knobs and earth,
that great brown flour that you kiss each day.
There are dark stars in the cool evening and
you fondle them like killer birds' beaks.
But what I want to know is why when small boys
dig you up for curiosity and cut you in half
why each half lives and crawls away as if whole.
Have you no beginning and end? Which heart is
the real one? Which eye the seer? Why
is it in the infinite plan that you would
be severed and rise from the dead like a gargoyle
with two heads?

Think Not, Not For A Moment Let Your Mind
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Think not, not for a moment let your mind,
Wearied with thinking, doze upon the thought
That the work's done and the long day behind,
And beauty, since 'tis paid for, can be bought.
If in the moonlight from the silent bough
Suddenly with precision speak your name
The nightingale, be not assured that now
His wing is limed and his wild virtue tame.
Beauty beyond all feathers that have flown
Is free; you shall not hood her to your wrist,
Nor sting her eyes, nor have her for your own
In an fashion; beauty billed and kissed
Is not your turtle; tread her like a dove
She loves you not; she never heard of love.

In Midnight Sleep

IN midnight sleep, of many a face of anguish,
Of the look at first of the mortally wounded--of that indescribable
look;
Of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide,
I dream, I dream, I dream.
 
Of scenes of nature, fields and mountains;
Of skies, so beauteous after a storm--and at night the moon so
unearthly bright,
Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and gather
the heaps,
I dream, I dream, I dream.
 
Long, long have they pass'd--faces and trenches and fields;
Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure--or away
from the fallen,
Onward I sped at the time--But now of their forms at night,
I dream, I dream, I dream.

In the end, I made myself
Known to your wife as
A god would, in her own house, in

Without a body: she
Paused in her weaving, her head turning
First to the right, then left
Though it was hopeless of course
To trace that sound to any
Objective source: I doubt
She will return to her loom
With what she knows now. When
You see her again, tell her
This is how a god says goodbye:
If I am in her head forever
I am in your life forever.

AS I lay with my head in your lap, Camerado,
The confession I made I resume--what I said to you in the open air I
resume:
I know I am restless, and make others so;
I know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death;
(Indeed I am myself the real soldier;
It is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the red-striped
artilleryman;)
For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle
them;
I am more resolute because all have denied me, than I could ever have
been had all accepted me;
I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions,
majorities, nor ridicule;
And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me; 
And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;
...Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and
still urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,
Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.

If I can leave off burying the white
Soft petals fallen from the apple tree
(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,
Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea);
And go along with you ere you lose sight
Of what you came for and become like me,
Slave to a Springtime passion for the earth.
How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed
On through the watching for that early birth
When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,
The sturdy seedling with arched body comes
Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.

Portrait Of An Old Woman On The College Tavern Wall

Oh down at the tavern
the children are singing
around their round table
and around me still.
Did you hear what it said? I only said
how there is a pewter urn
pinned to the tavern wall,
as old as old is able
to be and be there still.
I said, the poets are tere
I hear them singing and lying
around their round table
and around me still.
Across the room is a wreath
made of a corpse's hair,
framed in glass on the wall,
as old as old is able
to be and be remembered still.
Did you hear what it said? I only said
how I want to be there and I
would sing my songs with the liars
and my lies with all the singers.
And I would, and I would but
it's my hair in the hair wreath,
my cup pinned to the tavern wall,
my dusty face they sing beneath.
Poets are sitting in my kitchen.
Why do these poets lie?
Why do children get children and
Did you hear what it said? I only said
how I want to be there,
Oh, down at the tavern
where the prophets are singing
around their round table
until they are still.
",a,Angry
1046,"At Pleasure Bay
Robert Pinsky
In the willows along the river at Pleasure Bay
A catbird singing, never the same phrase twice.
Here under the pines a little off the road
In 1927 the Chief of Police
And Mrs. W. killed themselves together,
Sitting in a roadster. Ancient unshaken pilings
And underwater chunks of still-mortared brick
In shapes like bits of puzzle strew the bottom
Where the landing was for Price's Hotel and Theater.
And here's where boats blew two blasts for the keeper
To shunt the iron swing-bridge. He leaned on the gears
Like a skipper in the hut that housed the works
And the bridge moaned and turned on its middle pier
To let them through. In the middle of the summer
Two or three cars might wait for the iron trusswork
Winching aside, with maybe a child to notice
A name on the stern in black-and-gold on white,
Sandpiper, Patsy Ann, Do Not Disturb,
The Idler. If a boat was running whiskey,
The bridge clanged shut behind it as it passed
And opened up again for the Coast Guard cutter
Slowly as a sundial, and always jammed halfway.
The roadbed whole, but opened like a switch,
The river pulling and coursing between the piers.
Never the same phrase twice, the catbird filling
The humid August evening near the inlet
With borrowed music that he melds and changes.
Dragonflies and sandflies, frogs in the rushes, two bodies
Not moving in the open car among the pines,
A sliver of story. The tenor at Price's Hotel,
In clown costume, unfurls the sorrow gathered
In ruffles at his throat and cuffs, high quavers
That hold like splashes of light on the dark water,
The aria's closing phrases, changed and fading.
And after a gap of quiet, cheers and applause
Audible in the houses across the river,
Some in the audience weeping as if they had melted
Inside the music. Never the same. In Berlin
The daughter of an English lord, in love
With Adolf Hitler, whom she has met. She is taking
Possession of the apartment of a couple,
Elderly well-off Jews. They survive the war
To settle here in the Bay, the old lady
Teaches piano, but the whole world swivels
And gapes at their feet as the girl and a high-up Nazi
Examine the furniture, the glass, the pictures,
The elegant story that was theirs and now
Is part of hers. A few months later the English
Enter the war and she shoots herself in a park,
An addled, upper-class girl, her life that passes
Into the lives of others or into a place.
The taking of lives--the Chief and Mrs. W.

Took theirs to stay together, as local ghosts.
Last flurries of kisses, the revolver's barrel,
Shivers of a story that a child might hear
And half remember, voices in the rushes,
A singing in the willows. From across the river,
Faint quavers of music, the same phrase twice and again,
Ranging and building. Over the high new bridge
The flashing of traffic homeward from the racetrack,
With one boat chugging under the arches, outward
Unnoticed through Pleasure Bay to the open sea.
Here's where the people stood to watch the theater
Burn on the water. All that night the fireboats
Kept playing their spouts of water into the blaze.
In the morning, smoking pilasters and beams.
Black smell of char for weeks, the ruin already
Soaking back into the river. After you die
You hover near the ceiling above your body
And watch the mourners awhile. A few days more
You float above the heads of the ones you knew
And watch them through a twilight. As it grows darker
You wander off and find your way to the river
And wade across. On the other side, night air,
Willows, the smell of the river, and a mass
Of sleeping bodies all along the bank,
A kind of singing from among the rushes
Calling you further forward in the dark.
You lie down and embrace one body, the limbs
Heavy with sleep reach eagerly up around you
And you make love until your soul brims up
And burns free out of you and shifts and spills
Down over into that other body, and you
Forget the life you had and begin again
On the same crossing--maybe as a child who passes
Through the same place. But never the same way twice.
Here in the daylight, the catbird in the willows,
The new caf&eacute;, with a terrace and a landing,
Frogs in the cattails where the swing-bridge was--
Here's where you might have slipped across the water
When you were only a presence, at Pleasure Bay.

Heart, We Will Forget Him
Emily Dickinson
Heart, we will forget him,
You and I, tonight!

Dirge Without Music
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
 
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,
A formula, a phrase remains, -- but the best is lost.
 
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the
love, -- 
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not
approve.
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the
world.
 
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.

Great Are The Myths
Walt Whitman
GREAT are the myths--I too delight in them;
Great are Adam and Eve--I too look back and accept them;
Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women, sages,
inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests.
Great is Liberty! great is Equality! I am their follower;
Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where you sail, I sail,
I weather it out with you, or sink with you.
 
Great is Youth--equally great is Old Age--great are the Day and
Night;
Great is Wealth--great is Poverty--great is Expression--great is
Silence.
 
Youth, large, lusty, loving--Youth, full of grace, force,
fascination!
Do you know that Old Age may come after you, with equal grace, force,
fascination? 
 
Day, full-blown and splendid--Day of the immense sun, action,
ambition, laughter,
The Night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and
restoring darkness.
 
Wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospitality;
But then the Soul's wealth, which is candor, knowledge, pride,
enfolding love;
(Who goes for men and women showing Poverty richer than wealth?)
 
Expression of speech! in what is written or said, forget not that
Silence is also expressive,
That anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold as the
coldest, may be without words.
 
Great is the Earth, and the way it became what it is;
Do you imagine it has stopt at this? the increase abandon'd?
Understand then that it goes as far onward from this, as this is from
the times when it lay in covering waters and gases, before man
had appear'd. 
 
Great is the quality of Truth in man;
The quality of truth in man supports itself through all changes,
It is inevitably in the man--he and it are in love, and never leave
each other.
 
The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eyesight;
If there be any Soul, there is truth--if there be man or woman there
is truth--if there be physical or moral, there is truth;
If there be equilibrium or volition, there is truth--if there be
things at all upon the earth, there is truth.

O truth of the earth! I am determin'd to press my way toward you;
Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the sea after you.
 
Great is Language--it is the mightiest of the sciences,
It is the fulness, color, form, diversity of the earth, and of men
and women, and of all qualities and processes; 
It is greater than wealth--it is greater than buildings, ships,
religions, paintings, music.
 
Great is the English speech--what speech is so great as the English?
Great is the English brood--what brood has so vast a destiny as the
English?
It is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the new
rule;
The new rule shall rule as the Soul rules, and as the love, justice,
equality in the Soul rule.
 
Great is Law--great are the few old land-marks of the law,
They are the same in all times, and shall not be disturb'd.
 
Great is Justice!
Justice is not settled by legislators and laws--it is in the Soul;
It cannot be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride, the
attraction of gravity, can; 
It is immutable--it does not depend on majorities--majorities or what
not, come at last before the same passionless and exact
tribunal.
 
For justice are the grand natural lawyers, and perfect judges--is it
in their Souls;
It is well assorted--they have not studied for nothing--the great
includes the less;
They rule on the highest grounds--they oversee all eras, states,
administrations.
 
The perfect judge fears nothing--he could go front to front before
God;
Before the perfect judge all shall stand back--life and death shall
stand back--heaven and hell shall stand back.
 
Great is Life, real and mystical, wherever and whoever;
Great is Death--sure as life holds all parts together, Death holds
all parts together.
 
Has Life much purport?--Ah, Death has the greatest purport.

Circe's Power
Louise Gluck
I never turned anyone into a pig.
Some people are pigs; I make them
Look like pigs.
 
I'm sick of your world
That lets the outside disguise the inside. Your men weren't bad men;
Undisciplined life
Did that to them. As pigs,
 
Under the care of
Me and my ladies, they
Sweetened right up.
 
Then I reversed the spell, showing you my goodness
As well as my power. I saw
 
We could be happy here,
As men and women are
When their needs are simple. In the same breath,
 
I foresaw your departure,
Your men with my help braving
The crying and pounding sea. You think
 
A few tears upset me? My friend,
Every sorceress is
A pragmatist at heart; nobody sees essence who can't
Face limitation. If I wanted only to hold you
 
I could hold you prisoner.

O Me! O Life!
Walt Whitman
O ME! O life!... of the questions of these recurring;
Of the endless trains of the faithless--of cities fill'd with the
foolish;
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I,
and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light--of the objects mean--of the
struggle ever renew'd;
Of the poor results of all--of the plodding and sordid crowds I see
around me;
Of the empty and useless years of the rest--with the rest me
intertwined;
The question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O
life?
 
Answer.
 
That you are here--that life exists, and identity;
That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.

Drum-Taps
Walt Whitman
Aroused and angry,
I thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war;
But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd, and I resign'd
myself,
To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead.
 
Drum-Taps
 
FIRST, O songs, for a prelude,
Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum, pride and joy in my city,
How she led the rest to arms--how she gave the cue,
How at once with lithe limbs, unwaiting a moment, she sprang;
(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!
O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than
steel!)
How you sprang! how you threw off the costumes of peace with
indifferent hand;
How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard
in their stead;
How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of
soldiers,)
How Manhattan drum-taps led. 
 
Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading;
Forty years as a pageant--till unawares, the Lady of this teeming and
turbulent city,
Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,
With her million children around her--suddenly,
At dead of night, at news from the south,
Incens'd, struck with clench'd hand the pavement.
 
A shock electric--the night sustain'd it;
Till with ominous hum, our hive at day-break pour'd out its myriads.
 
From the houses then, and the workshops, and through all the
doorways,
Leapt they tumultuous--and lo! Manhattan arming. 
 
To the drum-taps prompt,
The young men falling in and arming;
The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's
hammer, tost aside with precipitation;)
The lawyer leaving his office, and arming--the judge leaving the
court;
The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing
the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs;
The salesman leaving the store--the boss, book-keeper, porter, all
leaving;

Squads gather everywhere by common consent, and arm;
The new recruits, even boys--the old men show them how to wear their
accoutrements--they buckle the straps carefully;
Outdoors arming--indoors arming--the flash of the musket-barrels;
The white tents cluster in camps--the arm'd sentries around--the
sunrise cannon, and again at sunset; 
Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark
from the wharves;
(How good they look, as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with
their guns on their shoulders!
How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces, and
their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)
The blood of the city up--arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere;
The flags flung out from the steeples of churches, and from all the
public buildings and stores;
The tearful parting--the mother kisses her son--the son kisses his
mother;
(Loth is the mother to part--yet not a word does she speak to detain
him;)
The tumultuous escort--the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the
way;
The unpent enthusiasm--the wild cheers of the crowd for their
favorites;
The artillery--the silent cannons, bright as gold, drawn along,
rumble lightly over the stones; 
(Silent cannons--soon to cease your silence!
Soon, unlimber'd, to begin the red business;)
All the mutter of preparation--all the determin'd arming;
The hospital service--the lint, bandages, and medicines;
The women volunteering for nurses--the work begun for, in earnest--no
mere parade now;
War! an arm'd race is advancing!--the welcome for battle--no turning
away;
War! be it weeks, months, or years--an arm'd race is advancing to
welcome it.
 
Mannahatta a-march!--and it's O to sing it well!
It's O for a manly life in the camp!
And the sturdy artillery! 
The guns, bright as gold--the work for giants--to serve well the
guns:
Unlimber them! no more, as the past forty years, for salutes for
courtesies merely;
Put in something else now besides powder and wadding.
 
And you, Lady of Ships! you Mannahatta!
Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city!
Often in peace and wealth you were pensive, or covertly frown'd amid
all your children;
But now you smile with joy, exulting old Mannahatta!

Mowing
Robert Frost
There was never a sound beside the wood but one,
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--
And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.
The fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows.
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.

Arrival At Santos
Elizabeth Bishop
Here is a coast; here is a harbor;
here, after a meager diet of horizon, is some scenery:
impractically shaped and--who knows?--self-pitying mountains,
sad and harsh beneath their frivolous greenery,
 
with a little church on top of one. And warehouses,
some of them painted a feeble pink, or blue,
and some tall, uncertain palms. Oh, tourist,
is this how this country is going to answer you
 
and your immodest demands for a different world,
and a better life, and complete comprehension
of both at last, and immediately,
after eighteen days of suspension?
 
Finish your breakfast. The tender is coming,
a strange and ancient craft, flying a strange and brilliant rag.
So that's the flag. I never saw it before.
I somehow never thought of there being a flag,
 
but of course there was, all along. And coins, I presume,
and paper money; they remain to be seen.
And gingerly now we climb down the ladder backward,
myself and a fellow passenger named Miss Breen,
 
descending into the midst of twenty-six freighters
waiting to be loaded with green coffee beaus.
Please, boy, do be more careful with that boat hook!
Watch out! Oh! It has caught Miss Breen's
 
skirt! There! Miss Breen is about seventy,
a retired police lieutenant, six feet tall,
with beautiful bright blue eyes and a kind expression.
Her home, when she is at home, is in Glens Fall
 
s, New York. There. We are settled.
The customs officials will speak English, we hope,
and leave us our bourbon and cigarettes.
Ports are necessities, like postage stamps, or soap,
 
but they seldom seem to care what impression they make,
or, like this, only attempt, since it does not matter,
the unassertive colors of soap, or postage stamps--
wasting away like the former, slipping the way the latter
 
do when we mail the letters we wrote on the boat,
either because the glue here is very inferior
or because of the heat. We leave Santos at once;
we are driving to the interior.

And carried, I supposed--to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold--
 
But not to touch, or wish for,

And so and so--had been to me,
Had God willed differently.

So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears

Ode To Meaning
Robert Pinsky
Dire one and desired one,
Savior, sentencer--
 
In an old allegory you would carry
A chained alphabet of tokens:
 
Ankh Badge Cross.
Dragon,
Engraved figure guarding a hallowed intaglio,
Jasper kinema of legendary Mind,
Naked omphalos pierced
By quills of rhyme or sense, torah-like: unborn
Vein of will, xenophile
Yearning out of Zero.
 
Untrusting I court you. Wavering
I seek your face, I read
That Crusoe's knife
Reeked of you, that to defile you
The soldier makes the rabbi spit on the torah.
""I'll drown my book"" says Shakespeare.
 
Drowned walker, revenant.
After my mother fell on her head, she became
More than ever your sworn enemy. She spoke
Sometimes like a poet or critic of forty years later.
Or she spoke of the world as Thersites spoke of the heroes,
""I think they have swallowed one another. I
Would laugh at that miracle.""
 
You also in the laughter, warrior angel:
Your helmet the zodiac, rocket-plumed
Your spear the beggar's finger pointing to the mouth
Your heel planted on the serpent Formulation
Your face a vapor, the wreath of cigarette smoke crowning
Bogart as he winces through it.
 
You not in the words, not even
Between the words, but a torsion,
A cleavage, a stirring.
 
You stirring even in the arctic ice,
Even at the dark ocean floor, even
In the cellular flesh of a stone.
Gas. Gossamer. My poker friends
Question your presence
In a poem by me, passing the magazine
One to another.
 
Not the stone and not the words, you
Like a veil over Arthur's headstone,
The passage from Proverbs he chose

While he was too ill to teach
And still well enough to read, I was
Beside the master craftsman
Delighting him day after day, ever
At play in his presence--you
 
A soothing veil of distraction playing over
Dying Arthur playing in the hospital,
Thumbing the Bible, fuzzy from medication,
Ever courting your presence,
And you the prognosis,
You in the cough.
 
Gesturer, when is your spur, your cloud?
You in the airport rituals of greeting and parting.
Indicter, who is your claimant?
Bell at the gate. Spiderweb iron bridge.
Cloak, video, aroma, rue, what is your
Elected silence, where was your seed?
 
What is Imagination
But your lost child born to give birth to you?
 
Dire one. Desired one.
Savior, sentencer--
 
Absence,
Or presence ever at play:
Let those scorn you who never
Starved in your dearth. If I
Dare to disparage
Your harp of shadows I taste
Wormwood and motor oil, I pour
Ashes on my head. You are the wound. You
Be the medicine.

Dirge For Two Veterans
Walt Whitman
THE last sunbeam
Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,
On the pavement here--and there beyond, it is looking,
Down a new-made double grave.
 
Lo! the moon ascending!
Up from the east, the silvery round moon;
Beautiful over the house tops, ghastly phantom moon;
Immense and silent moon.
 
I see a sad procession,
And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles; 
All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,
As with voices and with tears.
 
I hear the great drums pounding,
And the small drums steady whirring;
And every blow of the great convulsive drums,
Strikes me through and through.
 
For the son is brought with the father;
In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell;
Two veterans, son and father, dropt together,
And the double grave awaits them. 
 
Now nearer blow the bugles,
And the drums strike more convulsive;
And the day-light o'er the pavement quite has faded,
And the strong dead-march enwraps me.
 
In the eastern sky up-buoying,
The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd;
('Tis some mother's large, transparent face,
In heaven brighter growing.)
 
O strong dead-march, you please me!
O moon immense, with your silvery face you soothe me! 
O my soldiers twain! O my veterans, passing to burial!
What I have I also give you.
 
The moon gives you light,
And the bugles and the drums give you music;
And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,

My heart gives you love.

Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with
his bride;
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, plowing his field or gathering his
grain;
So fierce you whirr and pound, you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.
 
Beat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!
Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets:
Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? No sleepers
must sleep in those beds; 
No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--Would they
continue?
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the
judge?
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow.
 
Beat! beat! drums!--Blow! bugles! blow!
Make no parley--stop for no expostulation;
Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer;
Mind not the old man beseeching the young man;
Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties;
Make even the trestles to shake the dead, where they lie awaiting the
hearses, 
So strong you thump, O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.

Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter
We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove,
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after
The launching of the colored moths of Love.

We bound about our irreligious brows,
And fettered him with garlands of our own,
And spread a banquet in his frugal house.
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear
Though we should break our bodies in his flame,
And pour our blood upon his altar, here
Henceforward is a grove without a name,
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan,
Whence flee forever a woman and a man.

In an adjoining room—

We Brethren, are"", He said—
 
And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night—
We talked between the Rooms—

As It Was Written
Anne Sexton
Earth, earth,
riding your merry-go-round
toward extinction,
right to the roots,
thickening the oceans like gravy,
festering in your caves,
you are becoming a latrine.
Your trees are twisted chairs.
Your flowers moan at their mirrors,
and cry for a sun that doesn't wear a mask.
 
Your clouds wear white,
trying to become nuns
and say novenas to the sky.
The sky is yellow with its jaundice,
and its veins spill into the rivers
where the fish kneel down
to swallow hair and goat's eyes.
 
All in all, I'd say,
the world is strangling.
And I, in my bed each night,
listen to my twenty shoes
converse about it.
And the moon,
under its dark hood,
falls out of the sky each night,
with its hungry red mouth
to suck at my scars.

O breath
Elizabeth Bishop
Beneath that loved   and celebrated breast,
silent, bored really   blindly veined,
grieves, maybe   lives and lets
live, passes   bets,
something moving   but invisibly,
and with what clamor   why restrained
I cannot fathom   even a ripple.
(See the thin flying   of nine black hairs
four around one   five the other nipple,
flying almost intolerably   on your own breath.)
Equivocal, but what we have in common's   bound to be there,
whatever we must own   equivalents for,
something that maybe I   could bargain with
and make a separate peace   beneath
within   if never with.

A Life
Sylvia Plath
Touch it: it won't shrink like an eyeball,
This egg-shaped bailiwick, clear as a tear.
Here's yesterday, last year ---
Palm-spear and lily distinct as flora in the vast
Windless threadwork of a tapestry.
 
Flick the glass with your fingernail:
It will ping like a Chinese chime in the slightest air stir
Though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer.
The inhabitants are light as cork,
Every one of them permanently busy.
 
At their feet, the sea waves bow in single file.
Never trespassing in bad temper:
Stalling in midair,
Short-reined, pawing like paradeground horses.
Overhead, the clouds sit tasseled and fancy
 
As Victorian cushions. This family
Of valentine faces might please a collector:
They ring true, like good china.
 
Elsewhere the landscape is more frank.
The light falls without letup, blindingly.
 
A woman is dragging her shadow in a circle
About a bald hospital saucer.
It resembles the moon, or a sheet of blank paper
And appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg.
She lives quietly
 
With no attachments, like a foetus in a bottle,
The obsolete house, the sea, flattened to a picture
She has one too many dimensions to enter.
Grief and anger, exorcised,
Leave her alone now.
 
The future is a grey seagull
Tattling in its cat-voice of departure.
Age and terror, like nurses, attend her,
And a drowned man, complaining of the great cold,
Crawls up out of the sea.

The Break
Anne Sexton
It was also my violent heart that broke,
falling down the front hall stairs.
It was also a message I never spoke,
calling, riser after riser, who cares
 
about you, who cares, splintering up
the hip that was merely made of crystal,
the post of it and also the cup.
I exploded in the hallway like a pistol.
 
So I fell apart. So I came all undone.
Yes. I was like a box of dog bones.
But now they've wrapped me in like a nun.
Burst like firecrackers! Held like stones!
 
What a feat sailing queerly like Icarus
until the tempest undid me and I broke.
The ambulance drivers made such a fuss.
But when I cried, ""Wait for my courage!"" they smoked
 
and then they placed me, tied me up on their plate,
and wheeled me out to their coffin, my nest.
Slowly the siren slowly the hearse, sedate
as a dowager. At the E. W. they cut off my dress.
 
I cried, ""Oh Jesus, help me! Oh Jesus Christ!""
and the nurse replied, ""Wrong name. My name
is Barbara,"" and hung me in an odd device,
a buck's extension and a Balkan overhead frame.
 
The orthopedic man declared,
""You'll be down for a year."" His scoop. His news.
He opened the skin. He scraped. He pared
and drilled through bone for his four-inch screws.
 
That takes brute strength like pushing a cow
up hill. I tell you, it takes skill
and bedside charm and all that know how.
The body is a damn hard thing to kill.
 
But please don't touch or jiggle my bed.
I'm Ethan Frome's wife. I'll move when I'm able.
The T. V. hangs from the wall like a moose head.
I hide a pint of bourbon in my bedside table.
 
A bird full of bones, now I'm held by a sand bag.
The fracture was twice. The fracture was double.
The days are horizontal. The days are a drag.
All of the skeleton in me is in trouble.
 
Across the hall is the bedpan station.
The urine and stools pass hourly by my head

in silver bowls. They flush in unison
in the autoclave. My one dozen roses are dead.
 
The have ceased to menstruate. They hang
there like little dried up blood clots.
And the heart too, that cripple, how it sang
once. How it thought it could call the shots!
 
Understand what happened the day I fell.
My heart had stammered and hungered at
a marriage feast until the angel of hell
turned me into the punisher, the acrobat.
 
My bones are loose as clothespins,
as abandoned as dolls in a toy shop
and my heart, old hunger motor, with its sins
revved up like an engine that would not stop.
 
And now I spend all day taking care
of my body, that baby. Its cargo is scarred.
I anoint the bedpan. I brush my hair,
waiting in the pain machine for my bones to get hard,
 
for the soft, soft bones that were laid apart
and were screwed together. They will knit.
And the other corpse, the fractured heart,
I feed it piecemeal, little chalice. I'm good to it.
 
Yet lie a fire alarm it waits to be known.
It is wired. In it many colors are stored.
While my body's in prison, heart cells alone
have multiplied. My bones are merely bored
 
with all this waiting around. But the heart,
this child of myself that resides in the flesh,
this ultimate signature of the me, the start
of my blindness and sleep, builds a death cr&egrave;che.
 
The figures are placed at the grave of my bones.
All figures knowing it is the other death
they came for. Each figure standing alone.
The heart burst with love and lost its breath.
 
This little town, this little country is real
and thus it is so of the post and the cup
and thus of the violent heart. The zeal
of my house doth eat me up.

Compelled by calamity's magnet
They loiter and stare as if the house
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if they thought
Some scandal might any minute ooze
From a smoke-choked closet into light;
No deaths, no prodigious injuries
Glut these hunters after an old meat,
Blood-spoor of the austere tragedies.
 
Mother Medea in a green smock
Moves humbly as any housewife through
Her ruined apartments, taking stock
Of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery:
Cheated of the pyre and the rack,
The crowd sucks her last tear and turns away.

By The Sea
Emily Dickinson
I started early, took my dog,
And visited the sea;
The mermaids in the basement
Came out to look at me.
 
And frigates in the upper floor
Extended hempen hands,
Presuming me to be a mouse
Aground, upon the sands.
 
But no man moved me till the tide
Went past my simple shoe,
And past my apron and my belt,
And past my bodice too,
 
And made as he would eat me up
As wholly as a dew
Upon a dandelion's sleeve -
And then I started too.
 
And he - he followed close behind;
I felt his silver heel
Upon my ankle, - then my shoes
Would overflow with pearl.
 
Until we met the solid town,
No man he seemed to know;
And bowing with a mighty look
At me, the sea withdrew.

Macavity: The Mystery Cat
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw -
For he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime - Macavity's not there!
 
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime - Macavity's not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air -
But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's not there!
 
Mcavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.
 
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square -
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there!
 
He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)
And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard's.
And when the larder's looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,
Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke's been stifled,
Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair -
Ay, there's the wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there!
 
And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty's gone astray,
Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,
There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair -
But it's useless to investigate - Mcavity's not there!
And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:
`It must have been Macavity!' - but he's a mile away.
You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs,
Or engaged in doing complicated long-division sums.
 
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spaer:
At whatever time the deed took place - MACAVITY WASN'T THERE!
And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)
Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time
Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!

Of higher tides along the beach:
Nothing in this place.

my father moved through dooms of love
Edward Estlin Cummings
my father moved through dooms of love
through sames of am through haves of give,
singing each morning out of each night
my father moved through depths of height
 
this motionless forgetful where
turned at his glance to shining here;
that if(so timid air is firm)
under his eyes would stir and squirm
 
newly as from unburied which
floats the first who, his april touch
drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates
woke dreamers to their ghostly roots
 
and should some why completely weep
my father's fingers brought her sleep:
vainly no smallest voice might cry
for he could feel the mountains grow.
 
Lifting the valleys of the sea
my father moved through griefs of joy;
praising a forehead called the moon
singing desire into begin
 
joy was his song and joy so pure
a heart of star by him could steer
and pure so now and now so yes
the wrists of twilight would rejoice
 
keen as midsummer's keen beyond
conceiving mind of sun will stand,
so strictly(over utmost him
so hugely)stood my father's dream
 
his flesh was flesh his blood was blood:
no hungry man but wished him food;
no cripple wouldn't creep one mile
uphill to only see him smile.
 
Scorning the pomp of must and shall
my father moved through dooms of feel;
his anger was as right as rain
his pity was as green as grain
 
septembering arms of year extend
less humbly wealth to foe and friend
than he to foolish and to wise
offered immeasurable is
 
proudly and(by octobering flame
beckoned)as earth will downward climb,

so naked for immortal work
his shoulders marched against the dark
 
his sorrow was as true as bread:
no liar looked him in the head;
if every friend became his foe
he'd laugh and build a world with snow.
 
My father moved through theys of we,
singing each new leaf out of each tree
(and every child was sure that spring
danced when she heard my father sing)
 
then let men kill which cannot share,
let blood and flesh be mud and mire,
scheming imagine,passion willed,
freedom a drug that's bought and sold
 
giving to steal and cruel kind,
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind,
to differ a disease of same,
conform the pinnacle of am
 
though dull were all we taste as bright,
bitter all utterly things sweet,
maggoty minus and dumb death
all we inherit,all bequeath
 
and nothing quite so least as truth
-i say though hate were why men breathe-
because my father lived his soul
love is the whole and more than all

The Refinery
Robert Pinsky
&quot;. . . our language, forged in the dark bycenturies of violent
pressure, underground,out of the stuff of dead life.&quot;
 
Thirsty and languorous after their long black sleep
The old gods crooned and shuffled and shook their heads.
Dry, dry. By railroad they set out
Across the desert of stars to drink the world
Our mouths had soaked
In the strange sentences we made
While they were asleep: a pollen-tinted
Slurry of passion and lapsed
Intention, whose imagined
Taste made the savage deities hiss and snort.
 
In the lightless carriages, a smell of snake
And coarse fur, glands of lymphless breath
And ichor, the avid stenches of
Immortal bodies.
 
Their long train clicked and sighed
Through the gulfs of night between the planets
And came down through the evening fog
Of redwood canyons. From the train
At sunset, fiery warehouse windows
Along a wharf. Then dusk, a gash of neon:
Bar. Black pinewoods, a junction crossing, glimpses
Of sluggish surf among the rocks, a moan
Of dreamy forgotten divinity calling and fading
Against the windows of a town. Inside
The train, a flash
Of dragonfly wings, an antlered brow.
 
Black night again, and then
After the bridge, a palace on the water:
 
The great Refinery--impossible city of lights,
A million bulbs tracing its turreted
Boulevards and mazes. The castle of a person
Pronounced alive, the Corporation: a fictional
Lord real in law.
 
Barbicans and torches
Along the siding where the engine slows
At the central tanks, a ward
Of steel palisades, valved and chandeliered.
 
The muttering gods
Greedily penetrate those bright pavilions--
Libation of Benzene, Naphthalene, Asphalt,
Gasoline, Tar: syllables
Fractioned and cracked from unarticulated

Crude, the smeared keep of life that fed
On itself in pitchy darkness when the gods
Were new--inedible, volatile
And sublimated afresh to sting
Our tongues who use it, refined from oil of stone.
 
The gods batten on the vats, and drink up
Lovecries and memorized Chaucer, lines from movies
And songs hoarded in mortmain: exiles' charms,
The basal or desperate distillates of breath
Steeped, brewed and spent
As though we were their aphids, or their bees,
That monstered up sweetness for them while they dozed.

Perhaps the earth is floating,

Perhaps the stars are little paper cutups
made by some giant scissors,

Perhaps the moon is a frozen tear,
I do not know.
Perhaps God is only a deep voice
heard by the deaf,
I do not know.
 
Perhaps I am no one.
True, I have a body
and I cannot escape from it.
I would like to fly out of my head,
but that is out of the question.
It is written on the tablet of destiny
that I am stuck here in this human form.
That being the case
I would like to call attention to my problem.
 
There is an animal inside me,
clutiching fast to my heart,
a huge carb.
The doctors of Boston
have thrown up their hands.
They have tried scalpels,
needles, poison gasses adn the like.
The crab remains.
It is a great weight.
I try to forget it, go about my business,
cook the broccoli, open the shut books,
brush my teeth and tie my shoes.
I have tried prayer
but as I pray the crab grips harder
and the pain enlarges.
 
I had a dream once,
perhaps it was a dream,
that the crab was my ignorance of God.
But who am I to believe in dreams?

going by fields of goldenrod in

1.
They rise from the dawn and dress.

They raise the bundles to their heads
And their shadows broaden--
Dark ghosts grounded to nothing.

They grin and grip their skirts.

They finger the gold and purple beads
Circling their necks, lift them
Absently to their teeth. They speak

A language of kicked stones.

And it’s not the future their eyes see,
but history. It stretches
Like a dry road uphill before them.

They climb it.

2.
With small hands
They pat wet earth
Into brick. 

And we wonder
What they eat
And why they believe

In their gods
With faces
Like frightening toys.

We pay what they ask,
Minus something
For our trouble,

Wondering why they don’t
Pack up from the foot
Of the volcano,

Why they ruin their hands,
Their teeth, why they swallow
What they are given

Without a smile,
Or the hint of anger.

3.
A goat watches with eyes the inverse of danger,
Knowing there will always be some wafer of meaning
To savor on the tongue. Its munching
Is belief in the body and in the long dry grass. 
What it finds, it takes into its mouth as proof
that necessity is the same as plenty.

The child who tends the goat
Sits on his knees in the shade of a low tree. 
He considers what he knows. He lies down
On his side, takes the teat into his mouth
And drinks. What he does not know
Flickers in the breeze, brushes past his cheek,

The tip of his ear, and is quickly behind him.

4.
If it is true that the earth respires,
That it speaks only to those
Who command nothing--

If it is true that the first man
Was fashioned of corn.
Of divine shit. Of dust--

If a bale of cotton--

If color is trance,
And trance is to ride the back
Of the first great bird
In first flight--

If the world has ended twelve times--

If the atom is cognizant, coy;
If light is both pow-wow
And tango--

If, at the final trumpet,
Oil magnates will kiss the ankles
Of earth-caked girls who traipse
Along the highway’s edge,
Hugging the mountain
When trucks barrel past--

If Satchmo. If Leadbelly--

If wind on the horizon,
Thundering the trees,
Making all of our houses small--

Sylvia Plath
Mother, mother, what ill-bred aunt
Or what disfigured and unsightly
Cousin did you so unwisely keep
Unasked to my christening, that she
Sent these ladies in her stead
With heads like darning-eggs to nod
And nod and nod at foot and head
And at the left side of my crib?
 
Mother, who made to order stories
Of Mixie Blackshort the heroic bear,
Mother, whose witches always, always
Got baked into gingerbread, I wonder
Whether you saw them, whether you said
Words to rid me of those three ladies
Nodding by night around my bed,
Mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head.
 
In the hurricane, when father's twelve
Study windows bellied in
Like bubbles about to break, you fed
My brother and me cookies and Ovaltine
And helped the two of us to choir:
'Thor is angry; boom boom boom!
Thor is angry: we don't care!'
But those ladies broke the panes.
When on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,
Blinking flashlights like fireflies
And singing the glowworm song, I could
Not lift a foot in the twinkle-dress
But, heavy-footed, stood aside
In the shadow cast by my dismal-headed
Godmothers, and you cried and cried:
And the shadow stretched, the lights went out.
 
Mother, you sent me to piano lessons
And praised my arabesques and trills
Although each teacher found my touch
Oddly wooden in spite of scales
And the hours of practicing, my ear
Tone-deaf and yes, unteachable.
I learned, I learned, I learned elsewhere,
From muses unhired by you, dear mother.
 
I woke one day to see you, mother,
 
Floating above me in bluest air
On a green balloon bright with a million
Flowers and bluebirds that never were
Never, never, found anywhere.
But the little planet bobbed away
Like a soap-bubble as you called: Come here!

And I faced my traveling companions.
 
Day now, night now, at head, side, feet,
They stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
Faces blank as the day I was born.
Their shadows long in the setting sun
That never brightens or goes down.
And this is the kingdom you bore me to,
Mother, mother. But no frown of mine
Will betray the company I keep.

Have you got a Brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so--
 
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there,
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there--
 
Why, look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the fills,
And the bridges often go--
 
And later, in August it may be--
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life,
Some burning noon go dry!

Fer didn't I turn Republican
One o' the fust?
 
I 'lowed as how he'd beat the rest,
But old Si Perkins, he hemmed and guessed,
And sed as how it wuzn't best
To meddle with the trust.

To Earthward
Robert Frost
Love at the lips was touch
As sweet as I could bear;
And once that seemed too much;
I lived on air
That crossed me from sweet things,
The flow of - was it musk
From hidden grapevine springs
Down hill at dusk?
I had the swirl and ache
From sprays of honeysuckle
That when they're gathered shake
Dew on the knuckle.
I craved strong sweets, but those
Seemed strong when I was young;
The petal of the rose
It was that stung.
Now no joy but lacks salt
That is not dashed with pain
And weariness and fault;
I crave the stain
Of tears, the aftermark
Of almost too much love,
The sweet of bitter bark
And burning clove.
When stiff and sore and scarred
I take away my hand
From leaning on it hard
In grass and sand,
The hurt is not enough:
I long for weight and strength
To feel the earth as rough
To all my length.

Hysteria
Thomas Stearns Eliot
As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her
laughter and being part of it, until her teeth were
only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I
was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary
recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her
throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An
elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly
spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty
green iron table, saying: 'If the lady and gentleman
wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and
gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden ...' I
decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be
stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might
be collected, and I concentrated my attention with
careful subtlety to this end.

We Talk of Taxes...
Edna St. Vincent Millay
We talk of taxes, and I call you friend;
Well, such you are, -- but well enough we know
How thick about us root, how rankly grow
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend,
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow
Our steady senses; how such matters go
We are aware, and how such matters end.
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here;
With lovers such as we forevermore
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere
Receives the Table's ruin through her door,
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear,
Lets fall the coloured book upon the floor.

The Old Gumbie Cat
Thomas Stearns Eliot
I have a Gumbie Cat in mind, her name is Jennyanydots;
Her coat is of the tabby kind, with tiger stripes and leopard spots.
All day she sits upon the stair or on the steps or on the mat;
She sits and sits and sits and sits--and that's what makes a Gumbie Cat!
 
But when the day's hustle and bustle is done,
Then the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun.
And when all the family's in bed and asleep,
She tucks up her skirts to the basement to creep.
She is deeply concerned with the ways of the mice--
Their behaviour's not good and their manners not nice;
So when she has got them lined up on the matting,
She teachs them music, crocheting and tatting.
 
I have a Gumbie Cat in mind, her name is Jennyanydots;
Her equal would be hard to find, she likes the warm and sunny spots.
All day she sits beside the hearth or on the bed or on my hat:
She sits and sits and sits and sits--and that's what makes a Gumbie Cat!
 
But when the day's hustle and bustle is done,
Then the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun.
As she finds that the mice will not ever keep quiet,
She is sure it is due to irregular diet;
And believing that nothing is done without trying,
She sets right to work with her baking and frying.
She makes them a mouse--cake of bread and dried peas,
And a beautiful fry of lean bacon and cheese.
 
I have a Gumbie Cat in mind, her name is Jennyanydots;
The curtain-cord she likes to wind, and tie it into sailor-knots.
She sits upon the window-sill, or anything that's smooth and flat:
She sits and sits and sits and sits--and that's what makes a Gumbie Cat!
 
But when the day's hustle and bustle is done,
Then the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun.
She thinks that the cockroaches just need employment
To prevent them from idle and wanton destroyment.
So she's formed, from that lot of disorderly louts,
A troop of well-disciplined helpful boy-scouts,
With a purpose in life and a good deed to do--
And she's even created a Beetles' Tattoo.
 
So for Old Gumbie Cats let us now give three cheers--
On whom well-ordered households depend, it appears.

I Am in Need of Music
Elizabeth Bishop
I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling fingertips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!
 
There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.
",a,Sad

Beclouded
Emily Dickinson
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.
 
A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.

Three Women
Sylvia Plath
A Poem for Three Voices
 
Setting: A Maternity Ward and round about
 
FIRST VOICE:
I am slow as the world. I am very patient,
Turning through my time, the suns and stars
Regarding me with attention.
The moon's concern is more personal:
She passes and repasses, luminous as a nurse.
Is she sorry for what will happen? I do not think so.
She is simply astonished at fertility.
 
When I walk out, I am a great event.
I do not have to think, or even rehearse.
What happens in me will happen without attention.
The pheasant stands on the hill;
He is arranging his brown feathers.
I cannot help smiling at what it is I know.
Leaves and petals attend me. I am ready.
 
SECOND VOICE:
When I first saw it, the small red seep, I did not believe it.
I watched the men walk about me in the office. They were so flat!
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I had caught it,
That flat, flat, flatness from which ideas, destructions,
Bulldozers, guillotines, white chambers of shrieks proceed,
Endlessly proceed--and the cold angels, the abstractions.
I sat at my desk in my stockings, my high heels,
 
And the man I work for laughed: 'Have you seen something awful?
You are so white, suddenly.' And I said nothing.
I saw death in the bare trees, a deprivation.
I could not believe it. Is it so difficult
For the spirit to conceive a face, a mouth?
The letters proceed from these black keys, and these black keys proceed
From my alphabetical fingers, ordering parts,
 
Parts, bits, cogs, the shining multiples.
I am dying as I sit. I lose a dimension.
Trains roar in my ears, departures, departures!
The silver track of time empties into the distance,
The white sky empties of its promise, like a cup.
These are my feet, these mechanical echoes.
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am found wanting.
 
This is a disease I carry home, this is a death.
Again, this is a death. Is it the air,
The particles of destruction I suck up? Am I a pulse
That wanes and wanes, facing the cold angel?
Is this my lover then? This death, this death?
As a child I loved a lichen-bitten name.

Is this the one sin then, this old dead love of death?
 
THIRD VOICE:
I remember the minute when I knew for sure.
The willows were chilling,
The face in the pool was beautiful, but not mine--
It had a consequential look, like everything else,
And all I could see was dangers: doves and words,
Stars and showers of gold--conceptions, conceptions!
I remember a white, cold wing
 
And the great swan, with its terrible look,
Coming at me, like a castle, from the top of the river.
There is a snake in swans.
He glided by; his eye had a black meaning.
I saw the world in it--small, mean and black,
Every little word hooked to every little word, and act to act.
A hot blue day had budded into something.
 
I wasn't ready. The white clouds rearing
Aside were dragging me in four directions.
I wasn't ready.
I had no reverence.
I thought I could deny the consequence--
But it was too late for that. It was too late, and the face
Went on shaping itself with love, as if I was ready.
 
SECOND VOICE:
It is a world of snow now. I am not at home.
How white these sheets are. The faces have no features.
They are bald and impossible, like the faces of my children,
Those little sick ones that elude my arms.
Other children do not touch me: they are terrible.
They have too many colors, too much life. They are not quiet,
Quiet, like the little emptinesses I carry.
 
I have had my chances. I have tried and tried.
I have stitched life into me like a rare organ,
And walked carefully, precariously, like something rare.
I have tried not to think too hard. I have tried to be natural.
I have tried to be blind in love, like other women,
Blind in my bed, with my dear blind sweet one,
Not looking, through the thick dark, for the face of another.
 
I did not look. But still the face was there,
The face of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
The face of the dead one that could only be perfect
In its easy peace, could only keep holy so.
And then there were other faces. The faces of nations,
Governments, parliaments, societies,
The faceless faces of important men.

It is these men I mind:
They are so jealous of anything that is not flat! They are jealous gods
That would have the whole world flat because they are.
I see the Father conversing with the Son.
Such flatness cannot but be holy.
'Let us make a heaven,' they say.
'Let us flatten and launder the grossness from these souls.'
 
FIRST VOICE:
I am calm. I am calm. It is the calm before something awful:
The yellow minute before the wind walks, when the leaves
Turn up their hands, their pallors. It is so quiet here.
The sheets, the faces, are white and stopped, like clocks.
Voices stand back and flatten. Their visible hieroglyphs
Flatten to parchment screens to keep the wind off.
They paint such secrets in Arabic, Chinese!
 
I am dumb and brown. I am a seed about to break.
The brownness is my dead self, and it is sullen:
It does not wish to be more, or different.
Dusk hoods me in blue now, like a Mary.
O color of distance and forgetfulness!--
When will it be, the second when Time breaks
And eternity engulfs it, and I drown utterly?
 
I talk to myself, myself only, set apart--
Swabbed and lurid with disinfectants, sacrificial.
Waiting lies heavy on my lids. It lies like sleep,
Like a big sea. Far off, far off, I feel the first wave tug
Its cargo of agony toward me, inescapable, tidal.
And I, a shell, echoing on this white beach
Face the voices that overwhelm, the terrible element.
 
THIRD VOICE:
I am a mountain now, among mountainy women.
The doctors move among us as if our bigness
Frightened the mind. They smile like fools.
They are to blame for what I am, and they know it.
They hug their flatness like a kind of health.
And what if they found themselves surprised, as I did?
They would go mad with it.
 
And what if two lives leaked between my thighs?
I have seen the white clean chamber with its instruments.
It is a place of shrieks. It is not happy.
'This is where you will come when you are ready.'
The night lights are flat red moons. They are dull with blood.
I am not ready for anything to happen.
I should have murdered this, that murders me.
 
FIRST VOICE:
There is no miracle more cruel than this.

I am dragged by the horses, the iron hooves.
I last. I last it out. I accomplish a work.
Dark tunnel, through which hurtle the visitations,
The visitations, the manifestations, the startled faces.
I am the center of an atrocity.
What pains, what sorrows must I be mothering?
 
Can such innocence kill and kill? It milks my life.
The trees wither in the street. The rain is corrosive.
I taste it on my tongue, and the workable horrors,
The horrors that stand and idle, the slighted godmothers
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their satchels of instruments.
I shall be a wall and a roof, protecting.
I shall be a sky and a hill of good: O let me be!
 
A power is growing on me, an old tenacity.
I am breaking apart like the world. There is this blackness,
This ram of blackness. I fold my hands on a mountain.
The air is thick. It is thick with this working.
I am used. I am drummed into use.
My eyes are squeezed by this blackness.
I see nothing.
 
SECOND VOICE:
I am accused. I dream of massacres.
I am a garden of black and red agonies. I drink them,
Hating myself, hating and fearing. And now the world conceives
Its end and runs toward it, arms held out in love.
It is a love of death that sickens everything.
A dead sun stains the newsprint. It is red.
I lose life after life. The dark earth drinks them.
 
She is the vampire of us all. So she supports us,
Fattens us, is kind. Her mouth is red.
I know her. I know her intimately--
Old winter-face, old barren one, old time bomb.
Men have used her meanly. She will eat them.
Eat them, eat them, eat them in the end.
The sun is down. I die. I make a death.
 
FIRST VOICE:
Who is he, this blue, furious boy,
Shiny and strange, as if he had hurtled from a star?
He is looking so angrily!
He flew into the room, a shriek at his heel.
The blue color pales. He is human after all.
A red lotus opens in its bowl of blood;
They are stitching me up with silk, as if I were a material.
 
What did my fingers do before they held him?
What did my heart do, with its love?
I have never seen a thing so clear.

His lids are like the lilac-flower
And soft as a moth, his breath.
I shall not let go.
There is no guile or warp in him. May he keep so.
 
SECOND VOICE:
There is the moon in the high window. It is over.
How winter fills my soul! And that chalk light
Laying its scales on the windows, the windows of empty offices,
Empty schoolrooms, empty churches. O so much emptiness!
There is this cessation. This terrible cessation of everything.
These bodies mounded around me now, these polar sleepers--
What blue, moony ray ices their dreams?
 
I feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an instrument.
And that mad, hard face at the end of it, that O-mouth
Open in its gape of perpetual grieving.
It is she that drags the blood-black sea around
Month after month, with its voices of failure.
I am helpless as the sea at the end of her string.
I am restless. Restless and useless. I, too, create corpses.
 
I shall move north. I shall move into a long blackness.
I see myself as a shadow, neither man nor woman,
Neither a woman, happy to be like a man, nor a man
Blunt and flat enough to feel no lack. I feel a lack.
I hold my fingers up, ten white pickets.
See, the darkness is leaking from the cracks.
I cannot contain it. I cannot contain my life.
 
I shall be a heroine of the peripheral.
I shall not be accused by isolate buttons,
Holes in the heels of socks, the white mute faces
Of unanswered letters, coffined in a letter case.
I shall not be accused, I shall not be accused.
The clock shall not find me wanting, nor these stars
That rivet in place abyss after abyss.
 
THIRD VOICE:
I see her in my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
She is crying through the glass that separates us.
She is crying, and she is furious.
Her cries are hooks that catch and grate like cats.
It is by these hooks she climbs to my notice.
She is crying at the dark, or at the stars
That at such a distance from us shine and whirl.
 
I think her little head is carved in wood,
A red, hard wood, eyes shut and mouth wide open.
And from the open mouth issue sharp cries
Scratching at my sleep like arrows,
Scratching at my sleep, and entering my side.

My daughter has no teeth. Her mouth is wide.
It utters such dark sounds it cannot be good.
 
FIRST VOICE:
What is it that flings these innocent souls at us?
Look, they are so exhausted, they are all flat out
In their canvas-sided cots, names tied to their wrists,
The little silver trophies they've come so far for.
There are some with thick black hair, there are some bald.
Their skin tints are pink or sallow, brown or red;
They are beginning to remember their differences.
 
I think they are made of water; they have no expression.
Their features are sleeping, like light on quiet water.
They are the real monks and nuns in their identical garments.
I see them showering like stars on to the world--
On India, Africa, America, these miraculous ones,
These pure, small images. They smell of milk.
Their footsoles are untouched. They are walkers of air.
 
Can nothingness be so prodigal?
Here is my son.
His wide eye is that general, flat blue.
He is turning to me like a little, blind, bright plant.
One cry. It is the hook I hang on.
And I am a river of milk.
I am a warm hill.
 
SECOND VOICE:
I am not ugly. I am even beautiful.
The mirror gives back a woman without deformity.
The nurses give back my clothes, and an identity.
It is usual, they say, for such a thing to happen.
It is usual in my life, and the lives of others.
I am one in five, something like that. I am not hopeless.
I am beautiful as a statistic. Here is my lipstick.
 
I draw on the old mouth.
The red mouth I put by with my identity
A day ago, two days, three days ago. It was a Friday.
I do not even need a holiday; I can go to work today.
I can love my husband, who will understand.
Who will love me through the blur of my deformity
As if I had lost an eye, a leg, a tongue.
 
And so I stand, a little sightless. So I walk
Away on wheels, instead of legs, they serve as well.
And learn to speak with fingers, not a tongue.
The body is resourceful.
The body of a starfish can grow back its arms
And newts are prodigal in legs. And may I be
As prodigal in what lacks me.

THIRD VOICE:
She is a small island, asleep and peaceful,
And I am a white ship hooting: Goodbye, goodbye.
The day is blazing. It is very mournful.
The flowers in this room are red and tropical.
They have lived behind glass all their lives, they have been cared for
tenderly.
Now they face a winter of white sheets, white faces.
There is very little to go into my suitcase.
 
There are the clothes of a fat woman I do not know.
There is my comb and brush. There is an emptiness.
I am so vulnerable suddenly.
I am a wound walking out of hospital.
I am a wound that they are letting go.
I leave my health behind. I leave someone
Who would adhere to me: I undo her fingers like bandages: I go.
 
SECOND VOICE:
I am myself again. There are no loose ends.
I am bled white as wax, I have no attachments.
I am flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and scrapped, begun again.
There little black twigs do not think to bud,
Nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of rain.
This woman who meets me in windows--she is neat.
 
So neat she is transparent, like a spirit.
how shyly she superimposes her neat self
On the inferno of African oranges, the heel-hung pigs.
She is deferring to reality.
It is I. It is I--
Tasting the bitterness between my teeth.
The incalculable malice of the everyday.
 
FIRST VOICE:
How long can I be a wall, keeping the wind off?
How long can I be
Gentling the sun with the shade of my hand,
Intercepting the blue bolts of a cold moon?
The voices of loneliness, the voices of sorrow
Lap at my back ineluctably.
How shall it soften them, this little lullaby?
 
How long can I be a wall around my green property?
How long can my hands
Be a bandage to his hurt, and my words
Bright birds in the sky, consoling, consoling?
It is a terrible thing
To be so open: it is as if my heart
Put on a face and walked into the world.

THIRD VOICE:
Today the colleges are drunk with spring.
My black gown is a little funeral:
It shows I am serious.
The books I carry wedge into my side.
I had an old wound once, but it is healing.
I had a dream of an island, red with cries.
It was a dream, and did not mean a thing.
 
FIRST VOICE:
Dawn flowers in the great elm outside the house.
The swifts are back. They are shrieking like paper rockets.
I hear the sound of the hours
Widen and die in the hedgerows. I hear the moo of cows.
The colors replenish themselves, and the wet
Thatch smokes in the sun.
The narcissi open white faces in the orchard.
 
I am reassured. I am reassured.
These are the clear bright colors of the nursery,
The talking ducks, the happy lambs.
I am simple again. I believe in miracles.
I do not believe in those terrible children
Who injure my sleep with their white eyes, their fingerless hands.
They are not mine. They do not belong to me.
 
I shall meditate upon normality.
I shall meditate upon my little son.
He does not walk. He does not speak a word.
He is still swaddled in white bands.
But he is pink and perfect. He smiles so frequently.
I have papered his room with big roses,
I have painted little hearts on everything.
 
I do not will him to be exceptional.
It is the exception that interests the devil.
It is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
Or sits in the desert and hurts his mother's heart.
I will him to be common,
To love me as I love him,
And to marry what he wants and where he will.
 
THIRD VOICE:
Hot noon in the meadows. The buttercups
Swelter and melt, and the lovers
Pass by, pass by.
They are black and flat as shadows.
It is so beautiful to have no attachments!
I am solitary as grass. What is it I miss?
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is?

The swans are gone. Still the river
Remembers how white they were.
It strives after them with its lights.
It finds their shapes in a cloud.
What is that bird that cries
With such sorrow in its voice?
I am young as ever, it says. What is it I miss?
 
SECOND VOICE:
I am at home in the lamplight. The evenings are lengthening.
I am mending a silk slip: my husband is reading.
How beautifully the light includes these things.
There is a kind of smoke in the spring air,
A smoke that takes the parks, the little statues
With pinkness, as if a tenderness awoke,
A tenderness that did not tire, something healing.
 
I wait and ache. I think I have been healing.
There is a great deal else to do. My hands
Can stitch lace neatly on to this material. My husband
Can turn and turn the pages of a book.
And so we are at home together, after hours.
It is only time that weighs upon our hands.
It is only time, and that is not material.
 
The streets may turn to paper suddenly, but I recover
From the long fall, and find myself in bed,
Safe on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall.
I find myself again. I am no shadow
Though there is a shadow starting from my feet. I am a wife.
The city waits and aches. The little grasses
Crack through stone, and they are green with life.

My November Guest
Robert Frost
My Sorrow, when she's here with me,
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be;
She loves the bare, the withered tree;
She walks the sodden pasture lane.
Her pleasure will not let me stay.
She talks and I am fain to list:
She's glad the birds are gone away,
She's glad her simple worsted grey
Is silver now with clinging mist.
The desolate, deserted trees,
The faded earth, the heavy sky,
The beauties she so truly sees,
She thinks I have no eye for these,
And vexes me for reason why.
Not yesterday I learned to know
The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow,
But it were vain to tell her so,
And they are better for her praise

The High-Toned Old Christian Woman
Wallace Stevens
Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame.
Take the moral law and make a nave of it
And from the nave build haunted heaven.Thus,
The conscience is converted into palms,
Like windy citherns hankering for hymns.
We agree in principle.That's clear.But take
The opposing law and make a peristyle,
And from the peristyle project a masque
Beyond the planets.Thus, our bawdiness,
Unpurged by epitaph, indulged at last,
Is equally converted into palms,
Squiggling like saxophones.And palm for palm,
Madame, we are where we began.Allow,
Therefore, that in the planetary scene
Your disaffected flagellants, well-stuffed,
Smacking their muzzy bellies in parade,
Proud of such novelties of the sublime,
Such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk,
May, merely may, madame, whip from themselves
A jovial hullabaloo among the spheres.
This will make widows wince.But fictive things
Wink as they will.Wink most when widows wince.

The Imaginary Iceberg
Elizabeth Bishop
We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship,
although it meant the end of travel.
Although it stood stock-still like cloudy rock
and all the sea were moving marble.
We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship;
we'd rather own this breathing plain of snow
though the ship's sails were laid upon the sea
as the snow lies undissolved upon the water.
O solemn, floating field,
are you aware an iceberg takes repose
with you, and when it wakes may pasture on your snows?
 
This is a scene a sailor'd give his eyes for.
The ship's ignored. The iceberg rises
and sinks again; its glassy pinnacles
correct elliptics in the sky.
This is a scene where he who treads the boards
is artlessly rhetorical. The curtain
is light enough to rise on finest ropes
that airy twists of snow provide.
The wits of these white peaks
spar with the sun. Its weight the iceberg dares
upon a shifting stage and stands and stares.
 
The iceberg cuts its facets from within.
Like jewelry from a grave
it saves itself perpetually and adorns
only itself, perhaps the snows
which so surprise us lying on the sea.
Good-bye, we say, good-bye, the ship steers off
where waves give in to one another's waves

Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat
Thomas Stearns Eliot
There's a whisper down the line at 11.
When the Night Mail's ready to depart,
Saying ""Skimble where is Skimble has he gone to hunt the thimble?
We must find him or the train can't start.""
All the guards and all the porters and the stationmaster's daughters
They are searching high and low,
Saying ""Skimble where is Skimble for unless he's very nimble
Then the Night Mail just can't go.""
At 11.42 then the signal's nearly due
And the passengers are frantic to a man—
Then Skimble will appear and he'll saunter to the rear:
He's been busy in the luggage van!
 
He gives one flash of his glass-green eyes
And the signal goes ""All Clear!""
And we're off at last for the northern part
Of the Northern Hemisphere!
 
You may say that by and large it is Skimble who's in charge
Of the Sleeping Car Express.
From the driver and the guards to the bagmen playing cards
He will supervise them all, more or less.
Down the corridor he paces and examines all the faces
Of the travellers in the First and the Third;
He establishes control by a regular patrol
And he'd know at once if anything occurred.
He will watch you without winking and he sees what you are thinking
And it's certain that he doesn't approve
Of hilarity and riot, so the folk are very quiet
When Skimble is about and on the move.
You can play no pranks with Skimbleshanks!
He's a Cat that cannot be ignored;
So nothing goes wrong on the Northern Mail
When Skimbleshanks is aboard.
Oh, it's very pleasant when you have found your little den
With your name written up on the door.
And the berth is very neat with a newly folded sheet
And there's not a speck of dust on the floor.
There is every sort of light-you can make it dark or bright;
There's a handle that you turn to make a breeze.
There's a funny little basin you're supposed to wash your face in
And a crank to shut the window if you sneeze.
Then the guard looks in politely and will ask you very brightly
""Do you like your morning tea weak or strong?""
But Skimble's just behind him and was ready to remind him,
For Skimble won't let anything go wrong.
And when you creep into your cosy berth
And pull up the counterpane,
You ought to reflect that it's very nice
To know that you won't be bothered by mice—
You can leave all that to the Railway Cat,
The Cat of the Railway Train!

In the watches of the night he is always fresh and bright;
Every now and then he has a cup of tea
With perhaps a drop of Scotch while he's keeping on the watch,
Only stopping here and there to catch a flea.
You were fast asleep at Crewe and so you never knew
That he was walking up and down the station;
You were sleeping all the while he was busy at Carlisle,
Where he greets the stationmaster with elation.
But you saw him at Dumfries, where he speaks to the police
If there's anything they ought to know about:
When you get to Gallowgate there you do not have to wait—
For Skimbleshanks will help you to get out!
He gives you a wave of his long brown tail
Which says: ""I'll see you again!
You'll meet without fail on the Midnight Mail
The Cat of the Railway Train.""

The White Lilies
Louise Gluck
As a man and woman make
a garden between them like
a bed of stars, here
they linger in the summer evening
and the evening turns
cold with their terror: it
could all end, it is capable
of devastation. All, all
can be lost, through scented air
the narrow columns
uselessly rising, and beyond,
a churning sea of poppies--
 
Hush, beloved. It doesn't matter to me
how many summers I live to return:
this one summer we have entered eternity.
I felt your two hands
bury me to release its splendor.

In a Disused Graveyard
Robert Frost
The living come with grassy tread
To read the gravestones on the hill;
The graveyard draws the living still,
But never anymore the dead.
The verses in it say and say:
""The ones who living come today
To read the stones and go away
Tomorrow dead will come to stay.""
So sure of death the marbles rhyme,
Yet can't help marking all the time
How no one dead will seem to come.
What is it men are shrinking from? ell the stones: Men hate to die
And have stopped dying now forever.
I think they would believe the lie.

Wintering
Sylvia Plath
This is the easy time, there is nothing doing.
I have whirled the midwife's extractor,
I have my honey,
Six jars of it,
Six cat's eyes in the wine cellar,
 
Wintering in a dark without window
At the heart of the house
Next to the last tenant's rancid jam
and the bottles of empty glitters ----
Sir So-and-so's gin.
 
This is the room I have never been in
This is the room I could never breathe in.
The black bunched in there like a bat,
No light
But the torch and its faint
 
Chinese yellow on appalling objects ----
Black asininity. Decay.
Possession.
It is they who own me.
Neither cruel nor indifferent,
 
Only ignorant.
This is the time of hanging on for the bees--the bees
So slow I hardly know them,
Filing like soldiers
To the syrup tin
 
To make up for the honey I've taken.
Tate and Lyle keeps them going,
The refined snow.
It is Tate and Lyle they live on, instead of flowers.
They take it. The cold sets in.
 
Now they ball in a mass,
Black
Mind against all that white.
The smile of the snow is white.
It spreads itself out, a mile-long body of Meissen,
 
Into which, on warm days,
They can only carry their dead.
The bees are all women,
Maids and the long royal lady.
They have got rid of the men,
 
The blunt, clumsy stumblers, the boors.
Winter is for women ----
The woman, still at her knitting,
At the cradle of Spanis walnut,

Her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think.
 
Will the hive survive, will the gladiolas
Succeed in banking their fires
To enter another year?
What will they taste of, the Christmas roses?
The bees are flying. They taste the spring.

Gathering Leaves

Spades take up leaves
No better than spoons,
And bags full of leaves
Are light as balloons.
I make a great noise
Of rustling all day
Like rabbit and deer
Running away.
But the mountains I raise
Elude my embrace,
Flowing over my arms
And into my face.
I may load and unload
Again and again
Till I fill the whole shed,
And what have I then?
Next to nothing for weight,
And since they grew duller
From contact with earth,
Next to nothing for color.
Next to nothing for use.
But a crop is a crop,
And who's to say where
The harvest shall stop?

The Eye-Mote

Blameless as daylight I stood looking
At a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,
Tails streaming against the green
Backdrop of sycamores. Sun was striking
White chapel pinnacles over the roofs,
Holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves
 
Steadily rooted though they were all flowing
Away to the left like reeds in a sea
When the splinter flew in and stuck my eye,
Needling it dark. Then I was seeing
A melding of shapes in a hot rain:
Horses warped on the altering green,
 
Outlandish as double-humped camels or unicorns,
Grazing at the margins of a bad monochrome,
Beasts of oasis, a better time.
Abrading my lid, the small grain burns:
Red cinder around which I myself,
Horses, planets and spires revolve.
 
Neither tears nor the easing flush
Of eyebaths can unseat the speck:
It sticks, and it has stuck a week.
I wear the present itch for flesh,
Blind to what will be and what was.
I dream that I am Oedipus.
 
What I want back is what I was
Before the bed, before the knife,
Before the brooch-pin and the salve
Fixed me in this parenthesis;
Horses fluent in the wind,
A place, a time gone out of mind.

Once by the Pacific

The shattered water made a misty din.
Great waves looked over others coming in,
And thought of doing something to the shore
That water never did to land before.
The clouds were low and hairy in the skies,
Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes.
You could not tell, and yet it looked as if
The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,
The cliff in being backed by continent;
It looked as if a night of dark intent
Was coming, and not only a night, an age.
Someone had better be prepared for rage.
There would be more than ocean-water broken
Before God's last Put out the light was spoken.

The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet?
Ah, but indeed, some day shall you awake,
Rather, from dreams of me, that at your side

But stern in my soul's chastity, have lain,
To walk the world forever for my sake,

Mending Wall
Robert Frost
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there.
I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
""Stay where you are until our backs are turned!""
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, ""Good fences make good neighbours.""
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
""Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offence.
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That wants it down."" I could say ""Elves"" to him,
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
He said it for himself. I see him there
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his father's saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbours.""

Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour
Wallace Stevens
Light the first light of evening
In which we rest and, for small reason, think
The world imagined is the ultimate good.
 
This is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous.
It is in that thought that we collect ourselves,
Out of all the indifferences, into one thing:
 
Within a single thing, a single shawl
Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth,
A light, a power, the miraculous influence.
 
Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves.
We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole,
A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.
 
Within its vital boundary, in the mind.
We say God and the imagination are one...
How high that highest candle lights the dark.
 
Out of this same light, out of the central mind,
We make a dwelling in the evening air,
In which being there together is enough.

The Demiurge's Laugh

It was far in the sameness of the wood;
I was running with joy on the Demon’s trail,
Though I knew what I hunted was no true god.
It was just as the light was beginning to fail
That I suddenly heard—all I needed to hear:
It has lasted me many and many a year.
The sound was behind me instead of before,
A sleepy sound, but mocking half,
As of one who utterly couldn’t care.
The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh,
Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went;
And well I knew what the Demon meant.
I shall not forget how his laugh rang out.
I felt as a fool to have been so caught,
And checked my steps to make pretence
It was something among the leaves I sought
(Though doubtful whether he stayed to see).
Thereafter I sat me against a tree.

Last Words
Sylvia Plath
I do not want a plain box, I want a sarcophagus
With tigery stripes, and a face on it
Round as the moon, to stare up.
I want to be looking at them when they come
Picking among the dumb minerals, the roots.
I see them already -- the pale, star-distance faces.
Now they are nothing, they are not even babies.
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the first gods.
They will wonder if I was important.
I should sugar and preserve my days like fruit!
My mirror is clouding over --
A few more breaths, and it will reflect nothing at all.
The flowers and the faces whiten to a sheet.
 
I do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam
In dreams, through mouth-hole or eye-hole. I can't stop it.
One day it won't come back. Things aren't like that.
They stay, their little particular lusters
Warmed by much handling. They almost purr.
When the soles of my feet grow cold,
The blue eye of my tortoise will comfort me.
Let me have my copper cooking pots, let my rouge pots
Bloom about me like night flowers, with a good smell.
They will roll me up in bandages, they will store my heart
Under my feet in a neat parcel.
I shall hardly know myself. It will be dark,
And the shine of these small things sweeter than the face of Ishtar.

Gerontion
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Thou hast nor youth nor age
But as it were an after dinner sleep
Dreaming of both.
 
Here I am, an old man in a dry month,
Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.
I was neither at the hot gates
Nor fought in the warm rain
Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,
Bitten by flies, fought.
My house is a decayed house,
And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,
Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,
Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.
The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;
Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.
 
I an old man,
A dull head among windy spaces.
 
Signs are taken for wonders. 'We would see a sign':
The word within a word, unable to speak a word,
Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year
Came Christ the tiger
 
In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,
To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk
Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero
With caressing hands, at Limoges
Who walked all night in the next room;
By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;
By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room
Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp
Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles
Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,
An old man in a draughty house
Under a windy knob.
 
After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now
History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors
And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,
Guides us by vanities. Think now
She gives when our attention is distracted
And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions
That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late
What's not believed in, or if still believed,
In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon
Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with
Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think

Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices
Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues
Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.
These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.
 
The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last
We have not reached conclusion, when I
Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last
I have not made this show purposelessly
And it is not by any concitation
Of the backward devils.
I would meet you upon this honestly.
I that was near your heart was removed therefrom
To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.
I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it
Since what is kept must be adulterated?
I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:
How should I use it for your closer contact?
 
These with a thousand small deliberations
Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,
Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,
With pungent sauces, multiply variety
In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,
Suspend its operations, will the weevil
Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled
Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear
In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits
Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,
White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,
And an old man driven by the Trades
To a sleepy corner.
 
Tenants of the house,
Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.

A Book
Emily Dickinson
There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul!

The Lost Ingredient
Anne Sexton
Almost yesterday, those gentle ladies stole
to their baths in Atlantic Cuty, for the lost
rites of the first sea of the first salt
running from a faucet. I have heard they sat
for hours in briny tubs, patting hotel towels
sweetly over shivered skin, smelling the stale
harbor of a lost ocean, praying at last
for impossible loves, or new skin, or still
another child. And since this was the style,
I don't suppose they knew what they had lost.
 
Almost yesterday, pushing West, I lost
ten Utah driving minutes, stopped to steal
past postcard vendors, crossed the hot slit
of macadam to touch the marvelous loosed
bobbing of The Salt Lake, to honor and assault
it in its proof, to wash away some slight
need for Maine's coast. Later the funny salt
itched in my pores and stung like bees or sleet.
I rinsed it off on Reno and hurried to steal
a better proof at tables where I always lost.
 
Today is made of yesterday, each time I steal
toward rites I do not know, waiting for the lost
ingredient, as if salt or money or even lust
would keep us calm and prove us whole at last.

Two Campers in Cloud Country
Sylvia Plath
(Rock Lake, Canada)
 
In this country there is neither measure nor balance
To redress the dominance of rocks and woods,
The passage, say, of these man-shaming clouds.
 
No gesture of yours or mine could catch their attention,
No word make them carry water or fire the kindling
Like local trolls in the spell of a superior being.
 
Well, one wearies of the Public Gardens: one wants a vacation
Where trees and clouds and animals pay no notice;
Away from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses.
 
It took three days driving north to find a cloud
The polite skies over Boston couldn't possibly accommodate.
Here on the last frontier of the big, brash spirit
 
The horizons are too far off to be chummy as uncles;
The colors assert themselves with a sort of vengeance.
Each day concludes in a huge splurge of vermilions
 
And night arrives in one gigantic step.
It is comfortable, for a change, to mean so little.
These rocks offer no purchase to herbage or people:
 
They are conceiving a dynasty of perfect cold.
In a month we'll wonder what plates and forks are for.
I lean to you, numb as a fossil. Tell me I'm here.
 
The Pilgrims and Indians might never have happened.
Planets pulse in the lake like bright amoebas;
The pines blot our voices up in their lightest sighs.
 
Around our tent the old simplicities sough
Sleepily as Lethe, trying to get in.
We'll wake blank-brained as water in the dawn.

A Solemn thing within the Soul
Emily Dickinson

 
A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe--
And golden hang--while farther up--
The Maker's Ladders stop--
And in the Orchard far below--
You hear a Being--drop--
 
A Wonderful--to feel the Sun
Still toiling at the Cheek
You thought was finished--
Cool of eye, and critical of Work--
He shifts the stem--a little--
To give your Core--a look--
 
But solemnest--to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer--Every Sun
The Single--to some lives.

Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire--nil nisi divinum stabile
est; caetera fumus--the gondola stopped, the old
palace was there, how charming its grey and pink--
goats and monkeys, with such hair too!--so the
countess passed on until she came through the
little park, where Niobe presented her with a
cabinet, and so departed.
 
Burbank crossed a little bridge
Descending at a small hotel;
Princess Volupine arrived,
They were together, and he fell.
 
Defunctive music under sea
Passed seaward with the passing bell
Slowly: the God Hercules
Had left him, that had loved him well.
 
The horses, under the axletree
Beat up the dawn from Istria
With even feet. Her shuttered barge
Burned on the water all the day.
 
But this or such was Bleistein's way:
A saggy bending of the knees
And elbows, with the palms turned out,
Chicago Semite Viennese.
 
A lustreless protrusive eye
Stares from the protozoic slime
At a perspective of Canaletto.
The smoky candle end of time
 
Declines. On the Rialto once.
The rats are underneath the piles.
The jew is underneath the lot.
Money in furs. The boatman smiles,
 
Princess Volupine extends
A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand
To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,
She entertains Sir Ferdinand
 
Klein. Who clipped the lion's wings
And flea'd his rump and pared his claws?
Thought Burbank, meditating on
Time's ruins, and the seven laws.

My no longer cherished,
Need we say it was not love,
Now that love is perished?

Not Heat Flames Up And Consumes

NOT heat flames up and consumes,
Not sea-waves hurry in and out,
Not the air, delicious and dry, the air of the ripe summer, bears
lightly along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,
Wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;
Not these--O none of these, more than the flames of me, consuming,
burning for his love whom I love!
O none, more than I, hurrying in and out:
--Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the
same;
O nor down-balls, nor perfumes, nor the high, rain-emitting clouds,
are borne through the open air,
Any more than my Soul is borne through the open air,
Wafted in all directions, O love, for friendship, for you.

Night Is My Sister, And How Deep In Love
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Night is my sister, and how deep in love,
How drowned in love and weedily washed ashore,
There to be fretted by the drag and shove
At the tide's edge, I lie -- these things and more:
Whose arm alone between me and the sand,
Whose voice alone, whose pitiful breath brought near,
Could thaw these nostrils and unlock this hand,
She could advise you, should you care to hear.
Small chance, however, in a storm so black,
A man will leave his friendly fire and snug
For a drowned woman's sake, and bring her back
To drip and scatter shells upon the rug.
No one but Night, with tears on her dark face,
Watches beside me in this windy place.

Mark'd how, to explore the vacant, vast surrounding,
It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself;
Ever unreeling them--ever tirelessly speeding them.
 
And you, O my Soul, where you stand,
Surrounded, surrounded, in measureless oceans of space,
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,--seeking the spheres, to
connect them;
Till the bridge you will need, be form'd--till the ductile anchor
hold;
Till the gossamer thread you fling, catch somewhere, O my Soul.

A Celebration
William Carlos Williams
A middle-northern March, now as always--
gusts from the South broken against cold winds--
but from under, as if a slow hand lifted a tide,
it moves--not into April--into a second March,
 
the old skin of wind-clear scales dropping
upon the mold: this is the shadow projects the tree
upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere.
 
So we will put on our pink felt hat--new last year!
--newer this by virtue of brown eyes turning back
the seasons--and let us walk to the orchid-house,
see the flowers will take the prize tomorrow
at the Palace.
Stop here, these are our oleanders.
When they are in bloom--
You would waste words
It is clearer to me than if the pink
were on the branch. It would be a searching in
a colored cloud to reveal that which now, huskless,
shows the very reason for their being.
 
And these the orange-trees, in blossom--no need
to tell with this weight of perfume in the air.
If it were not so dark in this shed one could better
see the white.
It is that very perfume
has drawn the darkness down among the leaves.
Do I speak clearly enough?
It is this darkness reveals that which darkness alone
loosens and sets spinning on waxen wings--
not the touch of a finger-tip, not the motion
of a sigh. A too heavy sweetness proves
its own caretaker.
And here are the orchids!
Never having seen
such gaiety I will read these flowers for you:
This is an odd January, died--in Villon's time.
Snow, this is and this the stain of a violet
grew in that place the spring that foresaw its own doom.
 
And this, a certain July from Iceland:
a young woman of that place
breathed it toward the South. It took root there.
The color ran true but the plant is small.
 
This falling spray of snow-flakes is
a handful of dead Februaries
prayed into flower by Rafael Arevalo Martinez
of Guatemala.
Here's that old friend who
went by my side so many years: this full, fragile

head of veined lavender. Oh that April
that we first went with our stiff lusts
leaving the city behind, out to the green hill--
May, they said she was. A hand for all of us:
this branch of blue butterflies tied to this stem.
 
June is a yellow cup I'll not name; August
the over-heavy one. And here are--
russet and shiny, all but March. And March?
Ah, March--
Flowers are a tiresome pastime.
One has a wish to shake them from their pots
root and stem, for the sun to gnaw.
 
Walk out again into the cold and saunter home
to the fire. This day has blossomed long enough.
I have wiped out the red night and lit a blaze
instead which will at least warm our hands
and stir up the talk.
I think we have kept fair time.
Time is a green orchard.

Parable Of The Dove
Louise Gluck
A dove lived in a village.
When it opened its mouth
sweetness came out, sound
like a silver light around
the cherry bough. But
the dove wasn't satisfied.
 
It saw the villagers
gathered to listen under
the blossoming tree.
It didn't think: I
am higher that they are.
It wanted to wealk among them,
to experience the violence of human feeling,
in part for its song's sake.
 
So it became human.
It found passion, it found violence,
first conflated, then
as separate emotions
and these were not
contained by music. Thus
its song changed,
the sweet notes of its longing to become human
soured and flattened. Then
 
the world drew back; the mutant
fell from love
as from the cherry branch,
it fell stained with the bloody
fruit of the tree.
 
So it is true after all, not merely
a rule of art:
change your form and you change your nature.
And time does this to us.

When We Are Old And These Rejoicing Veins

When we are old and these rejoicing veins
Are frosty channels to a muted stream,
And out of all our burning their remains
No feeblest spark to fire us, even in dream,
This be our solace: that it was not said
When we were young and warm and in our prime,
Upon our couch we lay as lie the dead,
Sleeping away the unreturning time.
O sweet, O heavy-lidded, O my love,
When morning strikes her spear upon the land,
And we must rise and arm us and reprove
The insolent daylight with a steady hand,
Be not discountenanced if the knowing know
We rose from rapture but an hour ago.

O you youths, western youths,
So impatient, full of action, full of manly pride and friendship, 
Plain I see you, western youths, see you tramping with the foremost,

Have the elder races halted?
Do they droop and end their lesson, wearied, over there beyond the
seas?
We take up the task eternal, and the burden, and the lesson,

We debouch upon a newer, mightier world, varied world,
Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,

We detachments steady throwing,
Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,
Conquering, holding, daring, venturing, as we go, the unknown ways,

We the rivers stemming, vexing we, and piercing deep the mines
within;
We the surface broad surveying, we the virgin soil upheaving,

plateaus, 
From the mine and from the gully, from the hunting trail we come,

O I mourn and yet exult--I am rapt with love for all,

By those swarms upon our rear, we must never yield or falter,
Ages back in ghostly millions, frowning there behind us urging,

With accessions ever waiting, with the places of the dead quickly
fill'd, 
Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never stopping,

O to die advancing on!
Are there some of us to droop and die? has the hour come?
Then upon the march we fittest die, soon and sure the gap is fill'd,

Holding single or together, steady moving, to the front, all for us,

All the forms and shows, all the workmen at their work,
All the seamen and the landsmen, all the masters with their slaves,

All the hapless silent lovers,
All the prisoners in the prisons, all the righteous and the wicked,
All the joyous, all the sorrowing, all the living, all the dying,

We, a curious trio, picking, wandering on our way, 
Through these shores, amid the shadows, with the apparitions
pressing,

Lo! the darting bowling orb!
Lo! the brother orbs around! all the clustering suns and planets,
All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,
Pioneers! O pioneers!
 
These are of us, they are with us,
All for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo wait
behind,
We to-day's procession heading, we the route for travel clearing,
Pioneers! O pioneers! 
 
O you daughters of the west!
O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you wives!
Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,
Pioneers! O pioneers!
 
Minstrels latent on the prairies!
(Shrouded bards of other lands! you may sleep--you have done your
work;)
Soon I hear you coming warbling, soon you rise and tramp amid us,
Pioneers! O pioneers!
 
Not for delectations sweet;
Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the
studious; 
Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,
Pioneers! O pioneers!
 
Do the feasters gluttonous feast?
Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock'd and bolted doors?
Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,
Pioneers! O pioneers!

Has the night descended?
Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged, nodding on
our way?
Yet a passing hour I yield you, in your tracks to pause oblivious,
Pioneers! O pioneers! 
 
Till with sound of trumpet,
Far, far off the day-break call--hark! how loud and clear I hear it

Swift! to the head of the army!--swift! spring to your places, Pioneers! O

I Saw in Louisiana a Live-Oak Growing
Walt Whitman
I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,
All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,
Without any companion it stood there uttering joyous leaves of dark green,
And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,
But I wondered how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there
without its friend near, for I knew I could not,
And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it,
and twined around it a little moss,
And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,
It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,
(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)
Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;
For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana
solitary in a wide flat space,
Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend or lover near,
I know very well I could not.

Electra on Azalea Path
Sylvia Plath
The day you died I went into the dirt,
Into the lightless hibernaculum
Where bees, striped black and gold, sleep out the blizzard
Like hieratic stones, and the ground is hard.
It was good for twenty years, that wintering --
As if you never existed, as if I came
God-fathered into the world from my mother's belly:
Her wide bed wore the stain of divinity.
I had nothing to do with guilt or anything
When I wormed back under my mother's heart.
 
Small as a doll in my dress of innocence
I lay dreaming your epic, image by image.
Nobody died or withered on that stage.
Everything took place in a durable whiteness.
The day I woke, I woke on Churchyard Hill.
I found your name, I found your bones and all
Enlisted in a cramped necropolis
your speckled stone skewed by an iron fence.
 
In this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the dead
Crowd foot to foot, head to head, no flower
Breaks the soil. This is Azalea path.
A field of burdock opens to the south.
Six feet of yellow gravel cover you.
The artificial red sage does not stir
In the basket of plastic evergreens they put
At the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
Although the rains dissolve a bloody dye:
The ersatz petals drip, and they drip red.
 
Another kind of redness bothers me:
The day your slack sail drank my sister's breath
The flat sea purpled like that evil cloth
My mother unrolled at your last homecoming.
I borrow the silts of an old tragedy.
The truth is, one late October, at my birth-cry
A scorpion stung its head, an ill-starred thing;
My mother dreamed you face down in the sea.
 
The stony actors poise and pause for breath.
I brought my love to bear, and then you died.
It was the gangrene ate you to the bone
My mother said: you died like any man.
How shall I age into that state of mind?
I am the ghost of an infamous suicide,
My own blue razor rusting at my throat.
O pardon the one who knocks for pardon at
Your gate, father -- your hound-bitch, daughter, friend.
It was my love that did us both to death.

As I Ebb'd With the Ocean of Life
Walt Whitman

As I ebb'd with the ocean of life,
As I wended the shores I know,
As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,
Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,
Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,
I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,
Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,
Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,
The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the
land of the globe.
 
Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow
those slender windrows,
Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,
Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the
tide,
Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,
Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,
These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,
As I wended the shores I know,
As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types.
 

As I wend to the shores I know not,
As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd,
As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,
As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,
I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,
A few sands and dead leaves to gather,
Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.
 
O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,
Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,
Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I
have not once had the least idea who or what I am,
But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet
untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,
Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and
bows,
With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,
Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath.
 
I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single
object, and that no man ever can,
Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart
upon me and sting me,
Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.
 

You oceans both, I close with you,
We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing

not why,
These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all.
 
You friable shore with trails of debris,
You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot,
What is yours is mine my father.
 
I too Paumanok,
I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been
wash'd on your shores,
I too am but a trail of drift and debris,
I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island.
 
I throw myself upon your breast my father,
I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,
I hold you so firm till you answer me something.
 
Kiss me my father,
Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love,
Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring
I envy.
 

Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,)
Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother,
Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me,
Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you
or gather from you.
 
I mean tenderly by you and all,
I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we
lead, and following me and mine.
Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses,
Froth, snowy white, and bubbles,
(See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last,
See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,)
Tufts of straw, sands, fragments,
Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another,
From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell,
Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil,
Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown,
A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating,
drifted at random,
Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature,
Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets,
We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out
before you,
You up there walking or sitting,
Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.

Let you not say of me when I am old,
In pretty worship of my withered hands
Forgetting who I am, and how the sands
Of such a life as mine run red and gold
Even to the ultimate sifting dust, ""Behold,
Here walketh passionless age!"" -- for there expands
A curious superstition in these lands,
And by its leave some weightless tales are told.
 
In me no lenten wicks watch out the night;

Impious no less in ruin than in strength,
When I lie crumbled to the earth at length,
Let you not say, ""Upon this reverend site

The Cow In Apple-Time
Robert Frost
Something inspires the only cow of late
To make no more of a wall than an open gate,
And think no more of wall-builders than fools.
Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,
She scorns a pasture withering to the root.
She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten.
The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.
She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.
She bellows on a knoll against the sky.
Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.

Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird
Wallace Stevens
I
 
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the black bird.
 
II
 
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.
 
III
 
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
It was a small part of the pantomime.
 
IV
 
A man and a woman
Are one.
A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one.
 
V
 
I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.
 
VI
 
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass.
The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it, to and fro.
The mood
Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause.
 
VII
 
O thin men of Haddam,
Why do you imagine golden birds?
Do you not see how the blackbird
Walks around the feet
Of the women about you?
 
VIII

I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know.
 
IX
 
When the blackbird flew out of sight,
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.
 
X
 
At the sight of blackbirds
Flying in a green light,
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply.
 
XI
 
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach.
Once, a fear pierced him,
In that he mistook
The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds.
 
XII
 
The river is moving.
The blackbird must be flying.
 
XIII
 
It was evening all afternoon.
It was snowing
And it was going to snow.
The blackbird sat
In the cedar-limbs.

him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease a

A light exists in spring
Emily Dickinson
A light exists in spring
Not present on the year
At any other period.
When March is scarcely here
 
A color stands abroad
On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
But human naturefeels.
 
It waits upon the lawn;
It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
It almost speaks to me.
 
Then, as horizons step,
Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
It passes, and we stay:
 
A quality of loss
Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a sacrament.

To miss--if one shall meet--
The Burglar cannot rob--then--
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine--

To him who keeps an Orchis' heart--

On Old Man's Thought Of School
Walt Whitman
AN old man's thought of School;
An old man, gathering youthful memories and blooms, that youth itself
cannot.
 
Now only do I know you!
O fair auroral skies! O morning dew upon the grass!
 
And these I see--these sparkling eyes,
These stores of mystic meaning--these young lives,
Building, equipping, like a fleet of ships--immortal ships!
Soon to sail out over the measureless seas,
On the Soul's voyage.
 
Only a lot of boys and girls? 
Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes?
Only a Public School?
 
Ah more--infinitely more;
(As George Fox rais'd his warning cry, ""Is it this pile of brick and
mortar--these dead floors, windows, rails--you call the church?
Why this is not the church at all--the Church is living, ever living
Souls."")
 
And you, America,
Cast you the real reckoning for your present?
The lights and shadows of your future--good or evil?
To girlhood, boyhood look--the Teacher and the School.

What can I do with this bayonet?
Make a rose bush of it?
Poke it into the moon?

Spear a goldfish?

It was made
in my dream
for you.
My eyes were closed.
I was curled fetally
and yet I held a bayonet
that was for the earth of your stomach.
The belly button singing its puzzle.
The intestines winding like alpine roads.
It was made to enter you
as you have entered me
and to cut the daylight into you
and let out your buried heartland,
to let out the spoon you have fed me with,
to let out the bird that said fuck you,
to carve him onto a sculpture until he is white
and I could put him on a shelf,
an object unthinking as a stone,
but with all the vibrations
of a crucifix.

And who has projected beautiful words through the longest time? Have
I not outvied him? have I not said the words that shall stretch

And who has receiv'd the love of the most friends? For I know what it
is to receive the passionate love of many friends;
And who possesses a perfect and enamour'd body? For I do not believe
any one possesses a more perfect or enamour'd body than mine;

And who has made hymns fit for the earth? For I am mad with devouring

By The Bivouac's Fitful Flame
Walt Whitman
BY the bivouac's fitful flame,
A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow;--but first
I note,
The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim outline,
The darkness, lit by spots of kindled fire--the silence;
Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving;
The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily
watching me;)
While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,
Of life and death--of home and the past and loved, and of those that
are far away;
A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,
By the bivouac's fitful flame.

Tale of a Tub
Sylvia Plath
The photographic chamber of the eye
records bare painted walls, while an electric light
lays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw;
such poverty assaults the ego; caught
naked in the merely actual room,
the stranger in the lavatory mirror
puts on a public grin, repeats our name
but scrupulously reflects the usual terror.
 
Just how guilty are we when the ceiling
reveals no cracks that can be decoded? when washbowl
maintains it has no more holy calling
than physical ablution, and the towel
dryly disclaims that fierce troll faces lurk
in its explicit folds? or when the window,
blind with steam, will not admit the dark
which shrouds our prospects in ambiguous shadow?
 
Twenty years ago, the familiar tub
bred an ample batch of omens; but now
water faucets spawn no danger; each crab
and octopus -- scrabbling just beyond the view,
waiting for some accidental break
in ritual, to strike -- is definitely gone;
the authentic sea denies them and will pluck
fantastic flesh down to the honest bone.
 
We take the plunge; under water our limbs
waver, faintly green, shuddering away
from the genuine color of skin; can our dreams
ever blur the intransigent lines which draw
the shape that shuts us in? absolute fact
intrudes even when the revolted eye
is closed; the tub exists behind our back;
its glittering surfaces are blank and true.
 
Yet always the ridiculous nude flanks urge
the fabrication of some cloth to cover
such starkness; accuracy must not stalk at large:
each day demands we create our whole world over,
disguising the constant horror in a coat
of many-colored fictions; we mask our past
in the green of Eden, pretend future's shining fruit
can sprout from the navel of this present waste.
In this particular tub, two knees jut up
like icebergs, while minute brown hairs rise
on arms and legs in a fringe of kelp; green soap
navigates the tidal slosh of seas
breaking on legendary beaches; in faith
we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail
among sacred islands of the mad till death
shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real.

I died for beauty but was scarce
Emily Dickinson
I died for beauty but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
 
He questioned softly why I failed?
'For beauty,' I replied.
'And I for truth,--the two are one;
We brethren are,' he said.
 
And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.

Sonnet 04: Not In This Chamber Only At My Birth
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Not in this chamber only at my birth -- 
When the long hours of that mysterious night
Were over, and the morning was in sight -- 
I cried, but in strange places, steppe and firth
I have not seen, through alien grief and mirth;
And never shall one room contain me quite
Who in so many rooms first saw the light,
Child of all mothers, native of the earth.
 
So is no warmth for me at any fire
To-day, when the world's fire has burned so low;
I kneel, spending my breath in vain desire,
At that cold hearth which one time roared so strong,
And straighten back in weariness, and long
To gather up my little gods and go.

Going Gone
Anne Sexton
Over stone walls and barns,
miles from the black-eyed Susans,
over circus tents and moon rockets
you are going, going.
You who have inhabited me
in the deepest and most broken place,
are going, going.
An old woman calls up to you
from her deathbed deep in sores,
asking, ""What do you keep of her?""
She is the crone in the fables.
She is the fool at the supper
and you, sir, are the traveler.
Although you are in a hurry
you stop to open a small basket
and under layers of petticoats
you show her the tiger-striped eyes
that you have lately plucked,
you show her specialty, the lips,
those two small bundles,
you show her the two hands
that grip her fiercely,
one being mine, one being yours.
Torn right off at the wrist bone
when you started in your
impossible going, gone.
Then you place the basket
in the old woman's hollow lap
and as a last act she fondles
these artifacts like a child's head
and murmurs, ""Precious. Precious.""
And you are glad you have given
them to this one for she too
is making a trip.

But leave to those to come, the House itself.)

Out of that formula for Thee I sing.

But really I am neither for nor against institutions;

Only I will establish in the Mannahatta, and in every city of These

And in the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large,
that dents the water,
Without edifices, or rules, or trustees, or any argument,

I see before me now a traveling army halting,
Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,
Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,
Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,
The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the mountain,
The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,
And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, Studded, breaking out, the
eternal
stars.

To ponder on themselves, the while they stare
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,
When first the shaft into his vision shone
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they
Who, though once only and then but far away,
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.

One of my wishes is that those dark trees,
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,
Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,
But stretched away unto the edge of doom.
I should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness I should steal away,
Fearless of ever finding open land,
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.
I do not see why I should e'er turn back,
Or those should not set forth upon my track
To overtake me, who should miss me here
And long to know if still I held them dear.
They would not find me changed from him they knew--
Only more sure of all I though was true.

They shall enjoy materialism and the sight of products--they shall

They shall train themselves to go in public to become orators and

Strong and sweet shall their tongues be--poems and materials of poems
shall come from their lives--they shall be makers and finders;
Of them, and of their works, shall emerge divine conveyers, to convey

Because I do not hope to turn again
Because I do not hope
Because I do not hope to turn
Desiring this man's gift and that man's scope
I no longer strive to strive towards such things
(Why should the ag&egrave;d eagle stretch its wings?)
Why should I mourn
The vanished power of the usual reign?
 
Because I do not hope to know
The infirm glory of the positive hour
Because I do not think
Because I know I shall not know
The one veritable transitory power
Because I cannot drink
There, where trees flower, and springs flow, for there is nothing again
 
Because I know that time is always time
And place is always and only place
And what is actual is actual only for one time
And only for one place
I rejoice that things are as they are and
I renounce the bless&egrave;d face
And renounce the voice
Because I cannot hope to turn again
Consequently I rejoice, having to construct something
Upon which to rejoice
 
And pray to God to have mercy upon us
And pray that I may forget
These matters that with myself I too much discuss
Too much explain
Because I do not hope to turn again
Let these words answer
For what is done, not to be done again
May the judgement not be too heavy upon us
 
Because these wings are no longer wings to fly
But merely vans to beat the air
The air which is now thoroughly small and dry
Smaller and dryer than the will
Teach us to care and not to care Teach us to sit still.
 
Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death
Pray for us now and at the hour of our death.

Lady, three white leopards sat under a juniper-tree
In the cool of the day, having fed to sateity

On my legs my heart my liver and that which had been contained
In the hollow round of my skull. And God said
Shall these bones live? shall these
Bones live? And that which had been contained
In the bones (which were already dry) said chirping:
Because of the goodness of this Lady
And because of her loveliness, and because
She honours the Virgin in meditation,
We shine with brightness. And I who am here dissembled
Proffer my deeds to oblivion, and my love
To the posterity of the desert and the fruit of the gourd.
It is this which recovers
My guts the strings of my eyes and the indigestible portions
Which the leopards reject. The Lady is withdrawn
In a white gown, to contemplation, in a white gown.
Let the whiteness of bones atone to forgetfulness.
There is no life in them. As I am forgotten
And would be forgotten, so I would forget
Thus devoted, concentrated in purpose. And God said
Prophesy to the wind, to the wind only for only
The wind will listen. And the bones sang chirping
With the burden of the grasshopper, saying
 
Lady of silences
Calm and distressed
Torn and most whole
Rose of memory
Rose of forgetfulness
Exhausted and life-giving
Worried reposeful
The single Rose
Is now the Garden
Where all loves end
Terminate torment
Of love unsatisfied
The greater torment
Of love satisfied
End of the endless
Journey to no end
Conclusion of all that
Is inconclusible
Speech without word and
Word of no speech
Grace to the Mother
For the Garden
Where all love ends.
 
Under a juniper-tree the bones sang, scattered and shining
We are glad to be scattered, we did little good to each other,
Under a tree in the cool of day, with the blessing of sand,
Forgetting themselves and each other, united
In the quiet of the desert. This is the land which ye

Shall divide by lot. And neither division nor unity
Matters. This is the land. We have our inheritance.

The same shape twisted on the banister
Under the vapour in the fetid air
Struggling with the devil of the stairs who wears
The deceitul face of hope and of despair.
 
At the second turning of the second stair
I left them twisting, turning below;
There were no more faces and the stair was dark,
Damp, jagg&egrave;d, like an old man's mouth drivelling, beyond repair,
Or the toothed gullet of an ag&egrave;d shark.
 
At the first turning of the third stair
Was a slotted window bellied like the figs's fruit
And beyond the hawthorn blossom and a pasture scene
The broadbacked figure drest in blue and green
Enchanted the maytime with an antique flute.
Blown hair is sweet, brown hair over the mouth blown,
Lilac and brown hair;
Distraction, music of the flute, stops and steps of the mind
over the third stair,
Fading, fading; strength beyond hope and despair
Climbing the third stair.

Who walked between the violet and the violet
Whe walked between
The various ranks of varied green
Going in white and blue, in Mary's colour,
Talking of trivial things
In ignorance and knowledge of eternal dolour
Who moved among the others as they walked,
Who then made strong the fountains and made fresh the springs
 
Made cool the dry rock and made firm the sand
In blue of larkspur, blue of Mary's colour,
Sovegna vos

Here are the years that walk between, bearing
Away the fiddles and the flutes, restoring
One who moves in the time between sleep and waking, wearing
 
White light folded, sheathing about her, folded.
The new years walk, restoring
Through a bright cloud of tears, the years, restoring
With a new verse the ancient rhyme. Redeem
The time. Redeem
The unread vision in the higher dream
While jewelled unicorns draw by the gilded hearse.
 
The silent sister veiled in white and blue
Between the yews, behind the garden god,
Whose flute is breathless, bent her head and signed but spoke no word
 
But the fountain sprang up and the bird sang down
Redeem the time, redeem the dream
The token of the word unheard, unspoken
 
Till the wind shake a thousand whispers from the yew
 
And after this our exile

If the lost word is lost, if the spent word is spent
If the unheard, unspoken
Word is unspoken, unheard;
Still is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,
The Word without a word, the Word within
The world and for the world;
And the light shone in darkness and
Against the Word the unstilled world still whirled
About the centre of the silent Word.
 
O my people, what have I done unto thee.
 
Where shall the word be found, where will the word
Resound? Not here, there is not enough silence
Not on the sea or on the islands, not
On the mainland, in the desert or the rain land,
For those who walk in darkness
Both in the day time and in the night time
The right time and the right place are not here
No place of grace for those who avoid the face
No time to rejoice for those who walk among noise and deny the voice
 
Will the veiled sister pray for
Those who walk in darkness, who chose thee and oppose thee,
Those who are torn on the horn between season and season, time and time, between
Hour and hour, word and word, power and power, those who wait

In darkness? Will the veiled sister pray
For children at the gate
Who will not go away and cannot pray:
Pray for those who chose and oppose
 
O my people, what have I done unto thee.
 
Will the veiled sister between the slender
Yew trees pray for those who offend her
And are terrified and cannot surrender
And affirm before the world and deny between the rocks
In the last desert before the last blue rocks
The desert in the garden the garden in the desert
Of drouth, spitting from the mouth the withered apple-seed.
 
O my people.

Although I do not hope to turn again
Although I do not hope
Although I do not hope to turn
 
Wavering between the profit and the loss
In this brief transit where the dreams cross
The dreamcrossed twilight between birth and dying
(Bless me father) though I do not wish to wish these things
From the wide window towards the granite shore
The white sails still fly seaward, seaward flying
Unbroken wings
 
And the lost heart stiffens and rejoices
In the lost lilac and the lost sea voices
And the weak spirit quickens to rebel
For the bent golden-rod and the lost sea smell
Quickens to recover
The cry of quail and the whirling plover
And the blind eye creates
The empty forms between the ivory gates
And smell renews the salt savour of the sandy earth
 
This is the time of tension between dying and birth
The place of solitude where three dreams cross
Between blue rocks
But when the voices shaken from the yew-tree drift away
Let the other yew be shaken and reply.
 
Bless&egrave;d sister, holy mother, spirit of the fountain, spirit of the garden,
Suffer us not to mock ourselves with falsehood
Teach us to care and not to care
Teach us to sit still

Even among these rocks,
Our peace in His will
And even among these rocks
Sister, mother
And spirit of the river, spirit of the sea,
Suffer me not to be separated
 
And let my cry come unto Thee.

For thrift children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling,
About to be
Glorified for prime flesh and golden crackling
 
In a parsley halo;
Nor even one of the common barnyard sows,
Mire-smirched, blowzy,
 
Maunching thistle and knotweed on her snout-
cruise--
Bloat tun of milk
On the move, hedged by a litter of feat-foot ninnies
 
Shrilling her hulk
To halt for a swig at the pink teats. No. This vast
Brobdingnag bulk
 
Of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that black
compost,
Fat-rutted eyes
Dream-filmed. What a vision of ancient hoghood
must
 
Thus wholly engross
The great grandam!--our marvel blazoned a knight,
Helmed, in cuirass,
 
Unhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat
By a grisly-bristled
Boar, fabulous enough to straddle that sow's heat.
 
But our farmer whistled,
Then, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,
And the green-copse-castled
 
Pig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop,

Slowly, grunt
On grunt, up in the flickering light to shape
 
A monument
Prodigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want
Made lean Lent
 
Of kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint,
Proceeded to swill
The seven troughed seas and every earthquaking
continent.

Bring me the sunset in a cup

Bring me the sunset in a cup,
Reckon the morning's flagons up
And say how many Dew,
Tell me how far the morning leaps--
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
Who spun the breadth of blue!
 
Write me how many notes there be
In the new Robin's ecstasy
Among astonished boughs--
How many trips the Tortoise makes--
How many cups the Bee partakes,
The Debauchee of Dews!
 
Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
By withes of supple blue?
Whose fingers string the stalactite--
Who counts the wampum of the night
To see that none is due?
 
Who built this little Alban House
And shut the windows down so close
My spirit cannot see?
Who'll let me out some gala day
With implements to fly away,
Passing Pomposity?

I'm a riddle in nine syllables,
An elephant, a ponderous house,
A melon strolling on two tendrils.
O red fruit, ivory, fine timbers!
This loaf's big with its yeasty rising.
Money's new-minted in this fat purse.

Boarded the train there's no getting off.

Mirror
Sylvia Plath
I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
Whatever I see I swallow immediately
Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
I am not cruel, only truthful ‚
The eye of a little god, four-cornered.
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.
Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
 
Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
Searching my reaches for what she really is.
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
I am important to her. She comes and goes.
Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

Sylvia Plath
I shall never get you put together entirely,
Pieced, glued, and properly jointed.
Mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles
Proceed from your great lips.
It's worse than a barnyard.
 
Perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,
Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.
Thirty years now I have labored
To dredge the silt from your throat.
I am none the wiser.
 
Scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of Lysol
I crawl like an ant in mourning
Over the weedy acres of your brow
To mend the immense skull-plates and clear
The bald, white tumuli of your eyes.
 
A blue sky out of the Oresteia
Arches above us. O father, all by yourself
You are pithy and historical as the Roman Forum.
I open my lunch on a hill of black cypress.
Your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered
 
In their old anarchy to the horizon-line.
It would take more than a lightning-stroke
To create such a ruin.
Nights, I squat in the cornucopia
Of your left ear, out of the wind,
 
Counting the red stars and those of plum-color.
The sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.
My hours are married to shadow.
No longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel
On the blank stones of the landing.

Preludes
Thomas Stearns Eliot
The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o'clock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.
And then the lighting of the lamps.
 
II
 
The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.
 
With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.
 
III
 
You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters,
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed's edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.
 
IV
 
His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six o'clock;

And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.
 
I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.
 
Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.

Leaves Compared with Flowers
Robert Frost
A tree's leaves may be ever so good,
So may its bar, so may its wood;
But unless you put the right thing to its root
It never will show much flower or fruit.
But I may be one who does not care
Ever to have tree bloom or bear.
Leaves for smooth and bark for rough,
Leaves and bark may be tree enough.
Some giant trees have bloom so small
They might as well have none at all.
Late in life I have come on fern.
Now lichens are due to have their turn.
I bade men tell me which in brief,
Which is fairer, flower or leaf.
They did not have the wit to say,
Leaves by night and flowers by day.
Leaves and bar, leaves and bark,
To lean against and hear in the dark.
Petals I may have once pursued.
Leaves are all my darker mood.

Old Ireland
Walt Whitman
FAR hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,
Crouching over a grave, an ancient, sorrowful mother,
Once a queen--now lean and tatter'd, seated on the ground,
Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders;
At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,
Long silent--she too long silent--mourning her shrouded hope and
heir;
Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of
love.
 
Yet a word, ancient mother;
You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground, with forehead
between your knees;
O you need not sit there, veil'd in your old white hair, so
dishevel'd; 
For know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave;
It was an illusion--the heir, the son you love, was not really dead;
The Lord is not dead--he is risen again, young and strong, in another
country;
Even while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the grave,
What you wept for, was translated, pass'd from the grave,
The winds favor'd, and the sea sail'd it,
And now with rosy and new blood,
Moves to-day in a new country.

Sunday Morning
Wallace Stevens

 
Complacencies of the peignoir, and late
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,
And the green freedom of a cockatoo
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark
Encroachment of that old catastrophe,
As a calm darkens among water-lights.
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings
Seem things in some procession of the dead,
Winding across wide water, without sound.
The day is like wide water, without sound.
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet
Over the seas, to silent Palestine,
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.
 

 
Why should she give her bounty to the dead?
What is divinity if it can come
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,
In pungent fruit and bright green wings, or else
In any balm or beauty of the earth,
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?
Divinity must live within herself:
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;
All pleasures and all pains, remembering
The bough of summer and the winter branch.
These are the measure destined for her soul.
 

 
Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.
He moved among us, as a muttering king,
Magnificent, would move among his hinds,
Until our blood, commingling, virginal,
With heaven, brought such requital to desire
The very hinds discerned it, in a star.
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth
Seem all of paradise that we shall know?
The sky will be much friendlier then than now,
A part of labor and a part of pain,
And next in glory to enduring love,

Not this dividing and indifferent blue.
 

 
She says, ""I am content when wakened birds,
Before they fly, test the reality
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?""
There is not any haunt of prophecy,
Nor any old chimera of the grave,
Neither the golden underground, nor isle
Melodious, where spirits gat them home,
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm
Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured
As April's green endures; or will endure
Like her remembrance of awakened birds,
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped
By the consummation of the swallow's wings.
 

 
She says, ""But in contentment I still feel
The need of some imperishable bliss.""
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,
Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves
Of sure obliteration on our paths,
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love
Whispered a little out of tenderness,
She makes the willow shiver in the sun
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.
 

 
Is there no change of death in paradise?
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,
With rivers like our own that seek for seas
They never find, the same receding shores
That never touch with inarticulate pang?
Why set pear upon those river-banks
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?
Alas, that they should wear our colors there,
The silken weavings of our afternoons,
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!

Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,
Within whose burning bosom we devise
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.
 

 
Supple and turbulent, a ring of men
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn
Their boisterous devotion to the sun,
Not as a god, but as a god might be,
Naked among them, like a savage source.
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,
Out of their blood, returning to the sky;
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,
The windy lake wherein their lord delights,
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,
That choir among themselves long afterward.
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship
Of men that perish and of summer morn.
And whence they came and whither they shall go
The dew upon their feel shall manifest.
 

 
She hears, upon that water without sound,
A voice that cries, ""The tomb in Palestine
Is not the porch of spirits lingering.
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.""
We live in an old chaos of the sun,
Or old dependency of day and night,
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,
Of that wide water, inescapable.
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;
And, in the isolation of the sky,
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make
Ambiguous undulations as they sink,
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.

this would have been

of crocus in the damp grass.

late April. Spring
flowers in the neighbor's yard.
How many times, really, did the tree
flower on my birthday,
the exact day, not
before, not after? Substitution
of the immutable
for the shifting, the evolving.
Substitution of the image
for relentless earth. What
do I know of this place,

taken by a bonsai, voices

Your person fair, and feel a certain zest
To bear your body's weight upon my breast:
So subtly is the fume of life designed,
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,
And leave me once again undone, possessed.
Think not for this, however, the poor treason
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,

No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain
For greed like yours, no writhings of distress,
But only what you see... Look yet again -- 
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless.
Yet this alone out of my life I kept
Unto myself, lest any know me quite;

Unto the threshold of this room to-night

Long I Thought That Knowledge

LONG I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me--O if I could
but obtain knowledge!
Then my lands engrossed me--Lands of the prairies, Ohio's land, the
southern savannas, engrossed me--For them I would live--I would
be their orator;
Then I met the examples of old and new heroes--I heard of warriors,
sailors, and all dauntless persons--And it seemed to me that I
too had it in me to be as dauntless as any--and would be so;
And then, to enclose all, it came to me to strike up the songs of the
New World--And then I believed my life must be spent in
singing;
But now take notice, land of the prairies, land of the south
savannas, Ohio's land,
Take notice, you Kanuck woods--and you Lake Huron--and all that with
you roll toward Niagara--and you Niagara also,
And you, Californian mountains--That you each and all find somebody
else to be your singer of songs,
For I can be your singer of songs no longer--One who loves me is
jealous of me, and withdraws me from all but love,
With the rest I dispense--I sever from what I thought would suffice
me, for it does not--it is now empty and tasteless to me,
I heed knowledge, and the grandeur of The States, and the example of
heroes, no more, 
I am indifferent to my own songs--I will go with him I love,
It is to be enough for us that we are together--We never separate
again.

Penelope did this too.
And more than once: you can't keep weaving all day
And undoing it all through the night;
Your arms get tired, and the back of your neck gets tight;
And along towards morning, when you think it will never be light,
And your husband has been gone, and you don't know where, for years.
Suddenly you burst into tears;
There is simply nothing else to do.
 
And I thought, as I wiped my eyes on the corner of my apron:
This is an ancient gesture, authentic, antique,
In the very best tradition, classic, Greek;
Ulysses did this too.
But only as a gesture, -- a gesture which implied
To the assembled throng that he was much too moved to speak.
He learned it from Penelope...

And get back, back, back to you.

And a love of the rack and the screw.
And I said I do, I do.
So daddy, I'm finally through.

The voices just can't worm through.
 
If I've killed one man, I've killed two---
The vampire who said he was you
And drank my blood for a year,
Seven years, if you want to know.
Daddy, you can lie back now.

And the villagersnever liked you.

I ordered this, clean wood box
Square as a chair and almost too heavy to lift.
I would say it was the coffin of a midget
Or a square baby
Were there not such a din in it.
 
The box is locked, it is dangerous.
I have to live with it overnight
And I can't keep away from it.
There are no windows, so I can't see what is in there.
There is only a little grid, no exit.
 
I put my eye to the grid.
It is dark, dark,
With the swarmy feeling of African hands
Minute and shrunk for export,
Black on black, angrily clambering.
 
How can I let them out?
It is the noise that appalls me most of all,
The unintelligible syllables.
It is like a Roman mob,
Small, taken one by one, but my god, together!
 
I lay my ear to furious Latin.
I am not a Caesar.
I have simply ordered a box of maniacs.
They can be sent back.
They can die, I need feed them nothing, I am the owner.
 
I wonder how hungry they are.
I wonder if they would forget me
If I just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree.
There is the laburnum, its blond colonnades,
And the petticoats of the cherry.
 
They might ignore me immediately
In my moon suit and funeral veil.
I am no source of honey
So why should they turn on me?
Tomorrow I will be sweet God, I will set them free.

Death leaves Us homesick, who behind

Death leaves Us homesick, who behind,
Except that it is gone
Are ignorant of its Concern

A South Wind—has a pathos

A South Wind—has a pathos
Of individual Voice—

The fairer—for the farness—
And for the foreignhood.

A Curse Against Elegies
Anne Sexton
Oh, love, why do we argue like this?
I am tired of all your pious talk.
Also, I am tired of all the dead.
They refuse to listen,
so leave them alone.
Take your foot out of the graveyard,
they are busy being dead.
 
Everyone was always to blame:
the last empty fifth of booze,
the rusty nails and chicken feathers
that stuck in the mud on the back doorstep,
the worms that lived under the cat's ear
and the thin-lipped preacher
who refused to call
except once on a flea-ridden day
when he came scuffing in through the yard
looking for a scapegoat.
I hid in the kitchen under the ragbag.
 
I refuse to remember the dead.
And the dead are bored with the whole thing.
But you -- you go ahead,
go on, go on back down
into the graveyard,
lie down where you think their faces are;
talk back to your old bad dreams.

A Birthday Present
Sylvia Plath
What is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful?
It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?
 
I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is what I want.
When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking
 
'Is this the one I am too appear for,
Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?
 
Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,
Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules.
 
Is this the one for the annunciation?
My god, what a laugh!'
 
But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me.
I would not mind if it were bones, or a pearl button.
 
I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year.
After all I am alive only by accident.
 
I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way.
Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,
 
The diaphanous satins of a January window
White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath. O ivory!
 
It must be a tusk there, a ghost column.
Can you not see I do not mind what it is.
 
Can you not give it to me?
Do not be ashamed--I do not mind if it is small.
 
Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity.
Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,
 
The glaze, the mirrory variety of it.
Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate.
 
I know why you will not give it to me,
You are terrified
 
The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,
Bossed, brazen, an antique shield,
 
A marvel to your great-grandchildren.
Do not be afraid, it is not so.
 
I will only take it and go aside quietly.
You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,
 
No falling ribbons, no scream at the end.

I do not think you credit me with this discretion.
 
If you only knew how the veils were killing my days.
To you they are only transparencies, clear air.
 
But my god, the clouds are like cotton.
Armies of them. They are carbon monoxide.
 
Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in,
Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million
 
Probable motes that tick the years off my life.
You are silver-suited for the occasion. O adding machine-----
 
Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole?
Must you stamp each piece purple,
 
Must you kill what you can?
There is one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me.
 
It stands at my window, big as the sky.
It breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center
 
Where split lives congeal and stiffen to history.
Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger.
 
Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty
By the time the whole of it was delivered, and to numb to use it.
 
Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil.
If it were death
 
I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes.
I would know you were serious.
 
There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday.
And the knife not carve, but enter
 
Pure and clean as the cry of a baby,
And the universe slide from my side.

Pity Me Not Because The Light Of Day
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Pity me not because the light of day
At close of day no longer walks the sky;
Pity me not for beauties passed away
From field and thicket as the the year goes by;
Pity me not the waning of the moon,
Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,
Nor that a man's desire is hushed so soon,
And you no longer look with love on me.
This have I known always: Love is no more
Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,
Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore,
Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales:
Pity me that the heart is slow to learn
What the swift mind beholds at ever turn.

Now List To My Morning's Romanza
Walt Whitman
NOW list to my morning's romanza--I tell the signs of the Answerer;
To the cities and farms I sing, as they spread in the sunshine before
me.
 
A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother;
How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?
Tell him to send me the signs.
 
And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his right
hand in my left hand, and his left hand in my right hand,
And I answer for his brother, and for men, and I answer for him that
answers for all, and send these signs.
 
Him all wait for--him all yield up to--his word is decisive and
final,
Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, as amid
light,
Him they immerse, and he immerses them. 
 
Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people,
animals,
The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet ocean, (so
tell I my morning's romanza;)
All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will
buy,
The best farms--others toiling and planting, and he unavoidably
reaps,
The noblest and costliest cities--others grading and building, and he
domiciles there;
Nothing for any one, but what is for him--near and far are for him,
the ships in the offing,
The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if they are for
any body.
 
He puts things in their attitudes;
He puts to-day out of himself, with plasticity and love;
He places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and
sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest
never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them. 
 
He is the answerer:
What can be answer'd he answers--and what cannot be answer'd, he
shows how it cannot be answer'd.
 
A man is a summons and challenge;
(It is vain to skulk--Do you hear that mocking and laughter? Do you
hear the ironical echoes?)
 
Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,

beat up and down, seeking to give satisfaction;
He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and
down also.
 
Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly
and gently and safely, by day or by night;
He has the pass-key of hearts--to him the response of the prying of
hands on the knobs.
 
His welcome is universal--the flow of beauty is not more welcome or
universal than he is;
The person he favors by day, or sleeps with at night, is blessed. 
 
Every existence has its idiom--everything has an idiom and tongue;
He resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and
any man translates, and any man translates himself also;
One part does not counteract another part--he is the joiner--he sees
how they join.
 
He says indifferently and alike, How are you, friend? to the
President at his levee,
And he says, Good-day, my brother! to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-
field,
And both understand him, and know that his speech is right.
 
He walks with perfect ease in the Capitol,
He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,
Here is our equal, appearing and new.
 
Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,
And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he
has follow'd the sea, 
And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an
artist,
And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them;
No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has
follow'd it,
No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and
sisters there.
 
The English believe he comes of their English stock,
A Jew to the Jew he seems--a Russ to the Russ--usual and near,
removed from none.
 
Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,
The Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is sure, and the
Spaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is sure;
The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the
Mississippi, or St. Lawrence, or Sacramento, or Hudson, or
Paumanok Sound, claims him.

The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood; 
The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see
themselves in the ways of him--he strangely transmutes them,
They are not vile any more--they hardly know themselves, they are so
grown.

Burial
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Mine is a body that should die at sea!
And have for a grave, instead of a grave
Six feet deep and the length of me,
All the water that is under the wave!
And terrible fishes to seize my flesh,
Such as a living man might fear,
And eat me while I am firm and fresh, -- 
Not wait till I've been dead for a year!

City Trees
Edna St. Vincent Millay
The trees along this city street,
Save for the traffic and the trains,
Would make a sound as thin and sweet
As trees in country lanes.
 
And people standing in their shade
Out of a shower, undoubtedly
Would hear such music as is made
Upon a country tree.
 
Oh, little leaves that are so dumb
Against the shrieking city air,
I watch you when the wind has come, -- 
I know what sound is there.

The Tulip Bed
William Carlos Williams
The May sun--whom
all things imitate--
that glues small leaves to
the wooden trees
shone from the sky
through bluegauze clouds
upon the ground.
Under the leafy trees
where the suburban streets
lay crossed,
with houses on each corner,
tangled shadows had begun
to join
the roadway and the lawns.
With excellent precision
the tulip bed
inside the iron fence
upreared its gaudy
yellow, white and red,
rimmed round with grass,
reposedly.

Not In A Silver Casket Cool With Pearls
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Not in a silver casket cool with pearls
Or rich with red corundum or with blue,
Locked, and the key withheld, as other girls
Have given their loves, I give my love to you;
Not in a lovers'-knot, not in a ring
Worked in such fashion, and the legend plain -- 
Semper fidelis, where a secret spring
Kennels a drop of mischief for the brain:
Love in the open hand, no thing but that,
Ungemmed, unhidden, wishing not to hurt,
As one should bring you cowslips in a hat
Swung from the hand, or apples in her skirt,
I bring you, calling out as children do:
""Look what I have! -- And these are all for you.""

August 17th
Anne Sexton
Good for visiting hospitals or charitable work. Take some time to attend to your
health.
 
Surely I will be disquieted
by the hospital, that body zone--
bodies wrapped in elastic bands,
bodies cased in wood or used like telephones,
bodies crucified up onto their crutches,
bodies wearing rubber bags between their legs,
bodies vomiting up their juice like detergent, Here in this house
there are other bodies.
Whenever I see a six-year-old
swimming in our aqua pool
a voice inside me says what can't be told...
Ha, someday you'll be old and withered
and tubes will be in your nose
drinking up your dinner.
Someday you'll go backward. You'll close
up like a shoebox and you'll be cursed
as you push into death feet first.
 
Here in the hospital, I say,
that is not my body, not my body.
I am not here for the doctors
to read like a recipe.
No. I am a daisy girl
blowing in the wind like a piece of sun.
On ward 7 there are daisies, all butter and pearl
but beside a blind man who can only
eat up the petals and count to ten.
The nurses skip rope around him and shiver
as his eyes wiggle like mercury and then
they dance from patient to patient to patient
throwing up little paper medicine cups and playing
catch with vials of dope as they wait for new accidents.
Bodies made of synthetics. Bodies swaddled like dolls
whom I visit and cajole and all they do is hum
like computers doing up our taxes, dollar by dollar.
Each body is in its bunker. The surgeon applies his gum.
Each body is fitted quickly into its ice-cream pack
and then stitched up again for the long voyage
back.

The Armful
Robert Frost
For every parcel I stoop down to seize
I lose some other off my arms and knees,
And the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns --
Extremes too hard to comprehend at once,
Yet nothing I should care to leave behind.
With all I have to hold with hand and mind
And heart, if need be, I will do my best
To keep their building balanced at my breast.
I crouch down to prevent them as they fall;
Then sit down in the middle of them all.
I had to drop the armful in the road
And try to stack them in a better load.

Overnight, very
Whitely, discreetly,
Very quietly
 
Our toes, our noses
Take hold on the loam,
Acquire the air.
 
Nobody sees us,
Stops us, betrays us;
The small grains make room.
 
Soft fists insist on
Heaving the needles,
The leafy bedding,
 
Even the paving.
Our hammers, our rams,
Earless and eyeless,
 
Perfectly voiceless,
Widen the crannies,
Shoulder through holes. We
 
Diet on water,
On crumbs of shadow,
Bland-mannered, asking
 
Little or nothing.
So many of us!
So many of us!
 
We are shelves, we are
Tables, we are meek,
We are edible,
 
Nudgers and shovers
In spite of ourselves.
Our kind multiplies:
 
We shall by morning
Inherit the earth.
Our foot's in the door.

1.
The earth is dry and they live wanting.
Each with a small reservoir
Of furious music heavy in the throat. 
They drag it out and with nails in their feet
Coax the night into being. Brief believing. 
A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies.
And in this night that is not night,
Each word is a wish, each phrase
A shape their bodies ache to fill--

I’m going to braid my hair
Braid many colors into my hair
I’ll put a long braid in my hair
And write your name there

They defy gravity to feel tugged back.
The clatter, the mad slap of landing.

2.
And not just them. Not just
The ramshackle family, the tios,
Primitos, not just the bailaor
Whose heels have notched
And hammered time
So the hours flow in place
Like a tin river, marking
Only what once was.
Not just the voices scraping
Against the river, nor the hands
Nudging them farther, fingers
Like blind birds, palms empty,
Echoing. Not just the women
With sober faces and flowers
In their hair, the ones who dance
As though they're burying
Memory--one last time--
Beneath them.
And I hate to do it here.
To set myself heavily beside them.
Not now that they’ve proven
The body a myth, parable
For what not even language
Moves quickly enough to name.
If I call it pain, and try to touch it
With my hands, my own life,
It lies still and the music thins,
A pulse felt for through garments.
If I lean into the desire it starts from--
If I lean unbuttoned into the blow
Of loss after loss, love tossed
Into the ecstatic void--
It carries me with it farther,
To chords that stretch and bend
Like light through colored glass.
But it races on, toward shadows
Where the world I know
And the world I fear
Threaten to meet.

There is always a road,
The sea, dark hair, dolor.

Always a question
Bigger than itself--

They say you’re leaving Monday
Why can’t you leave on Tuesday?

Four Quartets 1: Burnt Norton
Thomas Stearns Eliot
I
 
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation.
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden. My words echo
Thus, in your mind.
But to what purpose
Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves
I do not know.
Other echoes
Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?
Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,
Round the corner. Through the first gate,
Into our first world, shall we follow
The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.
There they were, dignified, invisible,
Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,
In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,
And the bird called, in response to
The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,
And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses
Had the look of flowers that are looked at.
There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.
So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,
Along the empty alley, into the box circle,
To look down into the drained pool.
Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,
And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,
And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,
The surface glittered out of heart of light,
And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.
Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.
Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,
Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.
Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind
Cannot bear very much reality.
Time past and time future
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.

Garlic and sapphires in the mud
Clot the bedded axle-tree.
The trilling wire in the blood
Sings below inveterate scars
Appeasing long forgotten wars.
The dance along the artery
The circulation of the lymph
Are figured in the drift of stars
Ascend to summer in the tree
We move above the moving tree
In light upon the figured leaf
And hear upon the sodden floor
Below, the boarhound and the boar
Pursue their pattern as before
But reconciled among the stars.
 
At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,
But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.
The inner freedom from the practical desire,
The release from action and suffering, release from the inner
And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded
By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,
Erhebung without motion, concentration
Without elimination, both a new world
And the old made explicit, understood
In the completion of its partial ecstasy,
The resolution of its partial horror.
Yet the enchainment of past and future
Woven in the weakness of the changing body,
Protects mankind from heaven and damnation
Which flesh cannot endure.
Time past and time future
Allow but a little consciousness.
To be conscious is not to be in time
But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,
The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,
The moment in the draughty church at smokefall
Be remembered; involved with past and future.
Only through time time is conquered.

Here is a place of disaffection

Time before and time after
In a dim light: neither daylight
Investing form with lucid stillness
Turning shadow into transient beauty
With slow rotation suggesting permanence
Nor darkness to purify the soul
Emptying the sensual with deprivation
Cleansing affection from the temporal.
Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker
Over the strained time-ridden faces
Distracted from distraction by distraction
Filled with fancies and empty of meaning
Tumid apathy with no concentration
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind
That blows before and after time,
Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs
Time before and time after.
Eructation of unhealthy souls
Into the faded air, the torpid
Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,
Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,
Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here
Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.
 
Descend lower, descend only
Into the world of perpetual solitude,
World not world, but that which is not world,
Internal darkness, deprivation
And destitution of all property,
Desiccation of the world of sense,
Evacuation of the world of fancy,
Inoperancy of the world of spirit;
This is the one way, and the other
Is the same, not in movement
But abstention from movement; while the world moves
In appetency, on its metalled ways
Of time past and time future.

Time and the bell have buried the day,
The black cloud carries the sun away.
Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis
Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray
Clutch and cling?
 
Chill
Fingers of yew be curled
Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing
Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still
At the still point of the turning world.

Words move, music moves
Only in time; but that which is only living
Can only die. Words, after speech, reach
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,
Can words or music reach
The stillness, as a Chinese jar still
Moves perpetually in its stillness.
Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,
Not that only, but the co-existence,
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,
And the end and the beginning were always there
Before the beginning and after the end.
And all is always now. Words strain,
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
Will not stay still. Shrieking voices
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,
Always assail them. The Word in the desert
Is most attacked by voices of temptation,
The crying shadow in the funeral dance,
The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.
 
The detail of the pattern is movement,
As in the figure of the ten stairs.
Desire itself is movement
Not in itself desirable;
Love is itself unmoving,
Only the cause and end of movement,
Timeless, and undesiring
Except in the aspect of time
Caught in the form of limitation
Between un-being and being.
Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
Even while the dust moves
There rises the hidden laughter
Of children in the foliage
Quick now, here, now, always -- 
Ridiculous the waste sad time
Stretching before and after.

Cold wind of autumn, blowing loud
At dawn, a fortnight overdue,
Jostling the doors, and tearing through
My bedroom to rejoin the cloud,
I know -- for I can hear the hiss
And scrape of leaves along the floor -- 
How may boughs, lashed bare by this,
Will rake the cluttered sky once more.
Tardy, and somewhat south of east,
The sun will rise at length, made known
More by the meagre light increased
Than by a disk in splendour shown;
When, having but to turn my head,
Through the stripped maple I shall see,
Bleak and remembered, patched with red,
The hill all summer hid from me.

What is death, I ask.
What is life, you ask.
I give them both my buttocks,
my two wheels rolling off toward Nirvana.
They are neat as a wallet,
opening and closing on their coins,
the quarters, the nickels,
straight into the crapper.
Why shouldn't I pull down my pants
and moon the executioner
as well as paste raisins on my breasts?
Why shouldn't I pull down my pants
and show my little cunny to Tom
and Albert? They wee-wee funny.

I dream that I can piss in God's eye.
I dream I'm a boy with a zipper.

Ms. Dog.
Is she spilling her guts?
You bet.
Otherwise they cough...
The day is slipping away, why am I
out here, what do they want?
I am sorrowful in November...
(no they don't want that,
they want bee stings).
Toot, toot, tootsy don't cry.
Toot, toot, tootsy good-bye.
If you don't get a letter then
you'll know I'm in jail...

Remember that, Skeezix,

Who's thinking those things?
Ms. Dog! She's out fighting the dollars.
Milk is the American drink.
Oh queens of sorrows,

Say the woman is forty-four.
Say she is five seven-and-a-half.
Say her hair is stick color.
Say her eyes are chameleon.
Would you put her in a sack and bury her,
suck her down into the dumb dirt?
Some would.
If not, time will.
Ms. Dog, how much time you got left?
Ms. Dog, when you gonna feel that cold nose?
You better get straight with the Maker
cuz it's coming, it's a coming!
The cup of coffee is growing and growing
and they're gonna stick your little doll's head
into it and your lungs a gonna get paid
and your clothes a gonna melt.
Hear that, Ms. Dog!
You of the songs,
you of the classroom,
you of the pocketa-pocketa,
you hungry mother,
you spleen baby!
Them angels gonna be cut down like wheat.
Them songs gonna be sliced with a razor.
Them kitchens gonna get a boulder in the belly.

Them phones gonna be torn out at the root.
There's power in the Lord, baby,
and he's gonna turn off the moon.
He's gonna nail you up in a closet
and there'll be no more Atlantic,
no more dreams, no more seeds.
One noon as you walk out to the mailbox
He'll snatch you up --
a wopman beside the road like a red mitten.
 
There's a sack over my head.
I can't see. I'm blind.
The sea collapses.
The sun is a bone.
Hi-ho the derry-o,
we all fall down.
If I were a fisherman I could comprehend.
They fish right through the door
and pull eyes from the fire.
They rock upon the daybreak
and amputate the waters.
They are beating the sea,
they are hurting it,
delving down into the inscrutable salt.

When mother left the room
and left me in the big black
and sent away my kitty
to be fried in the camps
and took away my blanket
to wash the me out of it
I lay in the soiled cold and prayed.
It was a little jail in which
I was never slapped with kisses.
I was the engine that couldn't.
Cold wigs blew on the trees outside
and car lights flew like roosters
on the ceiling.
Cradle, you are a grave place.
 
Interrogator:
What color is the devil?
 
Anne:
Black and blue.
 
Interrogator:
What goes up the chimney?
 
Anne:

Fat Lazarus in his red suit.
 
Forgive us, Father, for we know not.
 
Ms. Dog prefers to sunbathe nude.
Let the indifferent sky look on.
So what!
Let Mrs. Sewal pull the curtain back,
from her second story.
So what!
Let United Parcel Service see my parcel.
La de dah.
Sun, you hammer of yellow,
you hat on fire,
you honeysuckle mama,
pour your blonde on me!
Let me laugh for an entire hour
at your supreme being, your Cadillac stuff,
because I've come a long way
from Brussels sprouts.
I've come a long way to peel off my clothes
and lay me down in the grass.
Once only my palms showed.
Once I hung around in my woolly tank suit,
drying my hair in those little meatball curls.
Now I am clothed in gold air with
one dozen halos glistening on my skin.
I am a fortunate lady.
I've gotten out of my pouch
and my teeth are glad
and my heart, that witness,
beats well at the thought.
 
Oh body, be glad.
You are good goods.
 
*
 
Middle-class lady,
you make me smile.
You dig a hole
and come out with a sunburn.
If someone hands you a glass of water
you start constructing a sailboat.
If someone hands you a candy wrapper,
you take it to the book binder.
Pocketa-pocketa.
 
Once upon a time Ms. Dog was sixty-six.
She had white hair and wrinkles deep as splinters.
her portrait was nailed up like Christ
and she said of it:

That's when I was forty-two,
down in Rockport with a hat on for the sun,
and Barbara drew a line drawing.
We were, at that moment, drinking vodka
and ginger beer and there was a chill in the air,
although it was July, and she gave me her sweater
to bundle up in. The next summer Skeezix tied
strings in that hat when we were fishing in Maine.
(It had gone into the lake twice.)
Of such moments is happiness made.
 
Forgive us, Father, for we know not.
 
Once upon a time we were all born,
popped out like jelly rolls
forgetting our fishdom,
the pleasuring seas,
the country of comfort,
spanked into the oxygens of death,
Good morning life, we say when we wake,
hail mary coffee toast
and we Americans take juice,
a liquid sun going down.
Good morning life.
To wake up is to be born.
To brush your teeth is to be alive.
To make a bowel movement is also desireable.
La de dah,
it's all routine.
Often there are wars
yet the shops keep open
and sausages are still fried.
People rub someone.
People copulate
entering each other's blood,
tying each other's tendons in knots,
transplanting their lives into the bed.
It doesn't matter if there are wars,
the business of life continues
unless you're the one that gets it.
Mama, they say, as their intestines
leak out. Even without wars
life is dangerous.
Boats spring leaks.
Cigarettes explode.
The snow could be radioactive.
Cancer could ooze out of the radio.
Who knows?
Ms. Dog stands on the shore
and the sea keeps rocking in
and she wants to talk to God.

Interrogator:
Why talk to God?
 
Anne:
It's better than playing bridge.
 
*
 
Learning to talk is a complex business.
My daughter's first word was utta,
meaning button.
Before there are words
do you dream?
In utero
do you dream?
Who taught you to suck?
And how come?
You don't need to be taught to cry.
The soul presses a button.
Is the cry saying something?
Does it mean help?
Or hello?
The cry of a gull is beautiful
and the cry of a crow is ugly
but what I want to know
is whether they mean the same thing.
Somewhere a man sits with indigestion
and he doesn't care.
A woman is buying bracelets
and earrings and she doesn't care.
La de dah.
 
Forgive us, Father, for we know not.
 
There are stars and faces.
There is ketchup and guitars.
There is the hand of a small child
when you're crossing the street.
There is the old man's last words:
More light! More light!
Ms. Dog wouldn't give them her buttocks.
She wouldn't moon at them.
Just at the killers of the dream.
The bus boys of the soul.
Or at death
who wants to make her a mummy.
And you too!
Wants to stuf her in a cold shoe
and then amputate the foot.
And you too!
La de dah.
What's the point of fighting the dollars

when all you need is a warm bed?
When the dog barks you let him in.
All we need is someone to let us in.
And one other thing:
to consider the lilies in the field.
Of course earth is a stranger, we pull at its
arms and still it won't speak.
The sea is worse.
It comes in, falling to its knees
but we can't translate the language.
It is only known that they are here to worship,
to worship the terror of the rain,
the mud and all its people,
the body itself,
working like a city,
the night and its slow blood
the autumn sky, mary blue.
but more than that,
to worship the question itself,
though the buildings burn
and the big people topple over in a faint.
Bring a flashlight, Ms. Dog,
and look in every corner of the brain
and ask and ask and ask
until the kingdom,
however queer,
will come.

Anecdote of the Jar
Wallace Stevens
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.
 
The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.
 
It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.
It did not give of bird or bush,
Like nothing else in Tennessee.

Four Quartets 4: Little Gidding
Thomas Stearns Eliot
I
 
Midwinter spring is its own season
Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown,
Suspended in time, between pole and tropic.
When the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,
The brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,
In windless cold that is the heart's heat,
Reflecting in a watery mirror
A glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.
And glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,
Stirs the dumb spirit: no wind, but pentecostal fire
In the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing
The soul's sap quivers. There is no earth smell
Or smell of living thing. This is the spring time
But not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow
Is blanched for an hour with transitory blossom
Of snow, a bloom more sudden
Than that of summer, neither budding nor fading,
Not in the scheme of generation.
Where is the summer, the unimaginable
Zero summer?
 
If you came this way,
Taking the route you would be likely to take
From the place you would be likely to come from,
If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges
White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.
It would be the same at the end of the journey,
If you came at night like a broken king,
If you came by day not knowing what you came for,
It would be the same, when you leave the rough road
And turn behind the pig-sty to the dull facade
And the tombstone. And what you thought you came for
Is only a shell, a husk of meaning
From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled
If at all. Either you had no purpose
Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured
And is altered in fulfilment. There are other places
Which also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,
Or over a dark lake, in a desert or a city -- 
But this is the nearest, in place and time,
Now and in England.
 
If you came this way,
Taking any route, starting from anywhere,
At any time or at any season,
It would always be the same: you would have to put off
Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity
Or carry report. You are here to kneel
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more

Than an order of words, the conscious occupation
Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.
And what the dead had no speech for, when living,
They can tell you, being dead: the communication
Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.
Here, the intersection of the timeless moment
Is England and nowhere. Never and always.
 
II
 
Ash on and old man's sleeve
Is all the ash the burnt roses leave.
Dust in the air suspended
Marks the place where a story ended.
Dust inbreathed was a house -- 
The walls, the wainscot and the mouse,
The death of hope and despair,
This is the death of air.
 
There are flood and drouth
Over the eyes and in the mouth,
Dead water and dead sand
Contending for the upper hand.
The parched eviscerate soil
Gapes at the vanity of toil,
Laughs without mirth.
This is the death of earth.
 
Water and fire succeed
The town, the pasture and the weed.
Water and fire deride
The sacrifice that we denied.
Water and fire shall rot
The marred foundations we forgot,
Of sanctuary and choir.
This is the death of water and fire.
 
In the uncertain hour before the morning
Near the ending of interminable night
At the recurrent end of the unending
After the dark dove with the flickering tongue
Had passed below the horizon of his homing
While the dead leaves still rattled on like tin
Over the asphalt where no other sound was
Between three districts whence the smoke arose
I met one walking, loitering and hurried
As if blown towards me like the metal leaves
Before the urban dawn wind unresisting.
And as I fixed upon the down-turned face
That pointed scrutiny with which we challenge
The first-met stranger in the waning dusk

I caught the sudden look of some dead master
Whom I had known, forgotten, half recalled
Both one and many; in the brown baked features
The eyes of a familiar compound ghost
Both intimate and unidentifiable.
So I assumed a double part, and cried
And heard another's voice cry: 'What! are you here?'
Although we were not. I was still the same,
Knowing myself yet being someone other -- 
And he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed
To compel the recognition they preceded.
And so, compliant to the common wind,
Too strange to each other for misunderstanding,
In concord at this intersection time
Of meeting nowhere, no before and after,
We trod the pavement in a dead patrol.
I said: 'The wonder that I feel is easy,
Yet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak:
I may not comprehend, may not remember.'
And he: 'I am not eager to rehearse
My thoughts and theory which you have forgotten.
These things have served their purpose: let them be.
So with your own, and pray they be forgiven
By others, as I pray you to forgive
Both bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten
And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.
For last year's words belong to last year's language
And next year's words await another voice.
But, as the passage now presents no hindrance
To the spirit unappeased and peregrine
Between two worlds become much like each other,
So I find words I never thought to speak
In streets I never thought I should revisit
When I left my body on a distant shore.
Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us
To purify the dialect of the tribe
And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight,
Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age
To set a crown upon your lifetime's effort.
First, the cold friction of expiring sense
Without enchantment, offering no promise
But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit
As body and soul begin to fall asunder.
Second, the conscious impotence of rage
At human folly, and the laceration
Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.
And last, the rending pain of re-enactment
Of all that you have done, and been; the shame
Of motives late revealed, and the awareness
Of things ill done and done to others' harm
Which once you took for exercise of virtue.
Then fools' approval stings, and honour stains.

From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit
Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fire
Where you must move in measure, like a dancer.'
The day was breaking. In the disfigured street
He left me, with a kind of valediction,
And faded on the blowing of the horn.
 
III
 
There are three conditions which often look alike
Yet differ completely, flourish in the same hedgerow:
Attachment to self and to things and to persons, detachment
From self and from things and from persons; and, growing between them,
indifference
Which resembles the others as death resembles life,
Being between two lives -- unflowering, between
The live and the dead nettle. This is the use of memory:
For liberation -- not less of love but expanding
Of love beyond desire, and so liberation
From the future as well as the past. Thus, love of a country
Begins as attachment to our own field of action
And comes to find that action of little importance
Though never indifferent. History may be servitude,
History may be freedom. See, now they vanish,
The faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved them,
To become renewed, transfigured, in another pattern.
 
Sin is Behovely, but
All shall be well, and
All manner of thing shall be well.
If I think, again, of this place,
And of people, not wholly commendable,
Of no immediate kin or kindness,
But of some peculiar genius,
All touched by a common genius,
United in the strife which divided them;
If I think of a king at nightfall,
Of three men, and more, on the scaffold
And a few who died forgotten
In other places, here and abroad,
And of one who died blind and quiet
Why should we celebrate
These dead men more than the dying?
It is not to ring the bell backward
Nor is it an incantation
To summon the spectre of a Rose.
We cannot revive old factions
We cannot restore old policies
Or follow an antique drum.
These men, and those who opposed them
And those whom they opposed
Accept the constitution of silence

And are folded in a single party.
Whatever we inherit from the fortunate
We have taken from the defeated
What they had to leave us -- a symbol:
A symbol perfected in death.
And all shall be well and
All manner of thing shall be well
By the purification of the motive
In the ground of our beseeching.
 
IV
 
The dove descending breaks the air
With flame of incandescent terror
Of which the tongues declare
The one discharge from sin and error.
The only hope, or else despair
Lies in the choice of pyre of pyre -- 
To be redeemed from fire by fire.
 
Who then devised the torment? Love.
Love is the unfamiliar Name
Behind the hands that wove
The intolerable shirt of flame
Which human power cannot remove.
We only live, only suspire
Consumed by either fire or fire.
 
V
 
What we call the beginning is often the end
And to make and end is to make a beginning.
The end is where we start from. And every phrase
And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,
Taking its place to support the others,
The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,
An easy commerce of the old and the new,
The common word exact without vulgarity,
The formal word precise but not pedantic,
The complete consort dancing together)
Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,
Every poem an epitaph. And any action
Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat
Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.
We die with the dying:
See, they depart, and we go with them.
We are born with the dead:
See, they return, and bring us with them.
The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
Are of equal duration. A people without history

Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern
Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails
On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel
History is now and England.
 
With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this
Calling
 
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
Through the unknown, unremembered gate
When the last of earth left to discover
Is that which was the beginning;
At the source of the longest river
The voice of the hidden waterfall
And the children in the apple-tree
Not known, because not looked for
But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
Between two waves of the sea.
Quick now, here, now, always -- 
A condition of complete simplicity
(Costing not less than everything)
And all shall be well and
All manner of thing shall be well
When the tongues of flame are in-folded
Into the crowned knot of fire
And the fire and the rose are one.

cities contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels
staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkan-

escapes off windowsills of Empire State out of the moon,
yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and
anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,
whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of
China under junk-withdrawal in Newark's bleak furnished room,

NOW finale to the shore!
Now, land and life, finale, and farewell!
Now Voyager depart! (much, much for thee is yet in store;)
Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,
Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,
Duly again to port, and hawser's tie, returning:

Embrace thy friends--leave all in order;
To port, and hawser's tie, no more returning,

Underground System
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Set the foot down with distrust upon the crust of the
world -- it is thin.
Moles are at work beneath us; they have tunneled the
sub-soil
With separate chambers; which at an appointed knock
Could be as one, could intersect and interlock. We walk
on the skin
Of life. No toil
Of rake or hoe, no lime, no phosphate, no rotation of
crops, no irrigation of the land,
Will coax the limp and flattened grain to stand
On that bad day, or feed to strength the nibbled root's of
our nation.
Ease has demoralized us, nearly so, we know
Nothing of the rigours of winter: The house has a roof
against -- the car a top against -- the snow.
All will be well, we say, it is a bit, like the rising of the
sun,
For our country to prosper; who can prevail against us?
No one.
The house has a roof; but the boards of its floor are
rotting, and hall upon hall
The moles have built their palace beneath us, we have
not far to fall.

Old Deuteronomy
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Old Deuteronomy's lived a long time;
He's a Cat who has lived many lives in succession.
He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
A long while before Queen Victoria's accession.
Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more--I am tempted to say, ninety-nine;
And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline.
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy,
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall,
The Oldest Inhabitant croaks: ""Well, of all . . .
Things. . . Can it be . . . really! . . . No!. . . Yes!. . .
Ho! hi!
Oh, my eye!
My mind may be wandering, but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!""
 
Old Deuteronomy sits in the street,
He sits in the High Street on market day;
The bullocks may bellow, the sheep they may bleat,
But the dogs and the herdsmen will turn them away.
The cars and the lorries run over the kerb,
And the villagers put up a notice: ROAD CLOSED--
So that nothing untoward may chance to distrub
Deuteronomy's rest when he feels so disposed
Or when he's engaged in domestic economy:
And the Oldest Inhabitant croaks: ""Well, of all . . .
Things. . . Can it be . . . really! . . . No!. . . Yes!. . .
Ho! hi!
Oh, my eye!
My sight's unreliable, but I can guess
That the cause of the trouble is Old Deuteronomy!""
 
Old Deuteronomy lies on the floor
Of the Fox and French Horn for his afternoon sleep;
And when the men say: ""There's just time for one more,""
Then the landlady from her back parlour will peep
And say: ""New then, out you go, by the back door,
For Old Deuteronomy mustn't be woken--
 
I'll have the police if there's any uproar""--
And out they all shuffle, without a word spoken.
The digestive repose of that feline's gastronomy
Must never be broken, whatever befall:
And the Oldest Inhabitant croaks: ""Well, of all . . .
Things. . . Can it be . . . really! . . . No!. . . Yes!. . .
Ho! hi!
Oh, my eye!
My legs may be tottery, I must go slow
And be careful of Old Deuteronomy!""
 
Of the awefull battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles:

together with some account of the participation of the
Pugs and the Poms, and the intervention of the Great
Rumpuscat
 
The Pekes and the Pollicles, everyone knows,
Are proud and implacable passionate foes;
It is always the same, wherever one goes.
And the Pugs and the Poms, although most people say
That they do not like fighting, yet once in a way,
They will now and again join in to the fray
And they
Bark bark bark bark
Bark bark BARK BARK
Until you can hear them all over the Park.
 
Now on the occasion of which I shall speak
Almost nothing had happened for nearly a week
(And that's a long time for a Pol or a Peke).
The big Police Dog was away from his beat--
I don't know the reason, but most people think
He'd slipped into the Wellington Arms for a drink--
And no one at all was about on the street
When a Peke and a Pollicle happened to meet.
They did not advance, or exactly retreat,
But they glared at each other, and scraped their hind
feet,
And they started to
Bark bark bark bark
Bark bark BARK BARK
Until you can hear them all over the Park.
 
Now the Peke, although people may say what they please,
Is no British Dog, but a Heathen Chinese.
And so all the Pekes, when they heard the uproar,
Some came to the window, some came to the door;
There were surely a dozen, more likely a score.
And together they started to grumble and wheeze
In their huffery-snuffery Heathen Chinese.
But a terrible din is what Pollicles like,
For your Pollicle Dog is a dour Yorkshire tyke,
And his braw Scottish cousins are snappers and biters,
And every dog-jack of them notable fighters;
And so they stepped out, with their pipers in order,
Playing When the Blue Bonnets Came Over the Border.
Then the Pugs and the Poms held no longer aloof,
But some from the balcony, some from the roof,
Joined in
To the din
With a
Bark bark bark bark
Bark bark BARK BARK
Until you can hear them all over the Park.

Now when these bold heroes together assembled,
That traffic all stopped, and the Underground trembled,
And some of the neighbours were so much afraid
That they started to ring up the Fire Brigade.
When suddenly, up from a small basement flat,
Why who should stalk out but the GREAT RUMPUSCAT.
His eyes were like fireballs fearfully blazing,
He gave a great yawn, and his jaws were amazing;
And when he looked out through the bars of the area,
You never saw anything fiercer or hairier.
And what with the glare of his eyes and his yawning,
The Pekes and the Pollicles quickly took warning.
He looked at the sky and he gave a great leap--
And they every last one of them scattered like sheep.
 
And when the Police Dog returned to his beat,
There wasn't a single one left in the street.

Caught -- the bubble
in the spirit level,
a creature divided;
and the compass needle
wobbling and wavering,
undecided.

and the rainbow-bird
from the narrow bevel
of the empty mirror,
flying wherever

Poems, Potatoes
Sylvia Plath
The word, defining, muzzles; the drawn line
Ousts mistier peers and thrives, murderous,
In establishments which imagined lines
 
Can only haunt. Sturdy as potatoes,
Stones, without conscience, word and line endure,
Given an inch. Not that they're gross (although
 
Afterthought often would have them alter
To delicacy, to poise) but that they
Shortchange me continuously: whether
 
More or other, they still dissatisfy.
Unpoemed, unpictured, the potato
Bunches its knobby browns on a vastly
Superior page; the blunt stone also.

Portrait of a Lady
Thomas Stearns Eliot
<i>Thou hast committed—
Fornication: but that was in another country,
And besides, the wench is dead.
The Jew of Malta.</i>
 
I
AMONG the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
You have the scene arrange itself—as it will seem to do—
With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";
And four wax candles in the darkened room,
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and fingertips.
""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.""
—And so the conversation slips
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
Through attenuated tones of violins
Mingled with remote cornets
And begins.
 
""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,
And how, how rare and strange it is, to find
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,
[For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
How keen you are!]
To find a friend who has these qualities,
Who has, and gives
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
How much it means that I say this to you—
Without these friendships—life, what cauchemar!""
 
Among the windings of the violins
And the ariettes
Of cracked cornets
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,
Capricious monotone
That is at least one definite ""false note.""
—Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,
Admire the monuments,
Discuss the late events,
Correct our watches by the public clocks.
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.

Now that lilacs are in bloom
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room

And twists one in his fingers while she talks.
""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands"";
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
""You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.""
I smile, of course,
And go on drinking tea.
""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall
My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world
To be wonderful and youthful, after all.""
 
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
""I am always sure that you understand
My feelings, always sure that you feel,
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.
 
You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.
You will go on, and when you have prevailed
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.
 
But what have I, but what have I, my friend,
To give you, what can you receive from me?
Only the friendship and the sympathy
Of one about to reach her journey's end.
 
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends....""
 
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
For what she has said to me?
You will see me any morning in the park
Reading the comics and the sporting page.
Particularly I remark
An English countess goes upon the stage.
A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,
Another bank defaulter has confessed.
I keep my countenance,
I remain self-possessed
Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
Recalling things that other people have desired.
Are these ideas right or wrong?
 
III
The October night comes down; returning as before
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.

""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
But that's a useless question.
You hardly know when you are coming back,
You will find so much to learn.""
My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac.
 
""Perhaps you can write to me.""
My self-possession flares up for a second;
This is as I had reckoned.
""I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.""
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark
Suddenly, his expression in a glass.
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.
 
""For everybody said so, all our friends,
They all were sure our feelings would relate
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
We must leave it now to fate.
You will write, at any rate.
Perhaps it is not too late.
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.""
 
And I must borrow every changing shape
To find expression ... dance, dance
Like a dancing bear,
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance—
 
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
Doubtful, for a while
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon...
Would she not have the advantage, after all?
This music is successful with a ""dying fall""
Now that we talk of dying—
And should I have the right to smile?

What new element before us unborn in nature? Is there
a new thing under the Sun?
At last inquisitive Whitman a modern epic, detonative,
Scientific theme
First penned unmindful by Doctor Seaborg with poison-
ous hand, named for Death's planet through the
sea beyond Uranus
whose chthonic ore fathers this magma-teared Lord of
Hades, Sire of avenging Furies, billionaire Hell-
King worshipped once
with black sheep throats cut, priests's face averted from
underground mysteries in single temple at Eleusis,
Spring-green Persephone nuptialed to his inevitable
Shade, Demeter mother of asphodel weeping dew,
her daughter stored in salty caverns under white snow,
black hail, grey winter rain or Polar ice, immemor-
able seasons before
Fish flew in Heaven, before a Ram died by the starry
bush, before the Bull stamped sky and earth
or Twins inscribed their memories in clay or Crab'd
flood
washed memory from the skull, or Lion sniffed the
lilac breeze in Eden--
Before the Great Year began turning its twelve signs,
ere constellations wheeled for twenty-four thousand
sunny years
slowly round their axis in Sagittarius, one hundred
sixty-seven thousand times returning to this night

black dumb tongueless unsmelling blast of Disil-

I guess your birthday in Earthling Night, I salute your
dreadful presence last majestic as the Gods,
Sabaot, Jehova, Astapheus, Adonaeus, Elohim, Iao,
Ialdabaoth, Aeon from Aeon born ignorant in an
Abyss of Light,
Sophia's reflections glittering thoughtful galaxies, whirl-
pools of starspume silver-thin as hairs of Einstein!
Father Whitman I celebrate a matter that renders Self
oblivion!
Grand Subject that annihilates inky hands & pages'
prayers, old orators' inspired Immortalities,
I begin your chant, openmouthed exhaling into spacious
sky over silent mills at Hanford, Savannah River,
Rocky Flats, Pantex, Burlington, Albuquerque
I yell thru Washington, South Carolina, Colorado,
Texas, Iowa, New Mexico,
Where nuclear reactors creat a new Thing under the

Sun, where Rockwell war-plants fabricate this death
stuff trigger in nitrogen baths,
Hanger-Silas Mason assembles the terrified weapon
secret by ten thousands, & where Manzano Moun-
tain boasts to store
its dreadful decay through two hundred forty millenia
while our Galaxy spirals around its nebulous core.
I enter your secret places with my mind, I speak with
your presence, I roar your Lion Roar with mortal
mouth.
One microgram inspired to one lung, ten pounds of
heavy metal dust adrift slow motion over grey
Alps
the breadth of the planet, how long before your radiance
speeds blight and death to sentient beings?
Enter my body or not I carol my spirit inside you,
Unnaproachable Weight,
O heavy heavy Element awakened I vocalize your con-
sciousness to six worlds
I chant your absolute Vanity. Yeah monster of Anger
birthed in fear O most
Ignorant matter ever created unnatural to Earth! Delusion
of metal empires!
Destroyer of lying Scientists! Devourer of covetous
Generals, Incinerator of Armies & Melter of Wars!
Judgement of judgements, Divine Wind over vengeful
nations, Molester of Presidents, Death-Scandal of
Capital politics! Ah civilizations stupidly indus-
trious!
Canker-Hex on multitudes learned or illiterate! Manu-
factured Spectre of human reason! O solidified
imago of practicioner in Black Arts
I dare your reality, I challenge your very being! I
publish your cause and effect!
I turn the wheel of Mind on your three hundred tons!
Your name enters mankind's ear! I embody your
ultimate powers!
My oratory advances on your vaunted Mystery! This
breath dispels your braggart fears! I sing your
form at last
behind your concrete & iron walls inside your fortress
of rubber & translucent silicon shields in filtered
cabinets and baths of lathe oil,
My voice resounds through robot glove boxes & ignot
cans and echoes in electric vaults inert of atmo-
sphere,
I enter with spirit out loud into your fuel rod drums
underground on soundless thrones and beds of
lead
O density! This weightless anthem trumpets transcendent
through hidden chambers and breaks through
iron doors into the Infernal Room!

Over your dreadful vibration this measured harmony
floats audible, these jubilant tones are honey and
milk and wine-sweet water
Poured on the stone black floor, these syllables are
barley groats I scatter on the Reactor's core,
I call your name with hollow vowels, I psalm your Fate
close by, my breath near deathless ever at your
side
to Spell your destiny, I set this verse prophetic on your
mausoleum walls to seal you up Eternally with
Diamond Truth! O doomed Plutonium.

Ghost House
Robert Frost
I dwell in a lonely house I know
That vanished many a summer ago,
And left no trace but the cellar walls,
And a cellar in which the daylight falls,
And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.
O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield
The woods come back to the mowing field;
The orchard tree has grown one copse
Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;
The footpath down to the well is healed.
I dwell with a strangely aching heart
In that vanished abode there far apart
On that disused and forgotten road
That has no dust-bath now for the toad.
Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;
The whippoorwill is coming to shout
And hush and cluck and flutter about:
I hear him begin far enough away
Full many a time to say his say
Before he arrives to say it out.
It is under the small, dim, summer star.
I know not who these mute folk are
Who share the unlit place with me--
Those stones out under the low-limbed tree
Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.
They are tireless folk, but slow and sad,
Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--
With none among them that ever sings,
And yet, in view of how many things,
As sweet companions as might be had.

The Man-moth
Elizabeth Bishop
          Here, above,
cracks in the buldings are filled with battered moonlight.
The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat.
It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on,
and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon.
He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties,
feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold,
of a temperature impossible to records in thermometers.
 
          But when the Man-Moth
pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface,
the moon looks rather different to him. He emerges
from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks
and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings.
He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,
proving the sky quite useless for protection.
He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb.
 
          Up the façades,
his shadow dragging like a photographer's cloth behind him
he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage
to push his small head through that round clean opening
and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light.
(Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.)
But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although
he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt.
 
          Then he returns
to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits,
he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains
fast enough to suit him. The doors close swiftly.
The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way
and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed,
without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort.
He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards.
 
          Each night he must
be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams.
Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie
his rushing brain. He does not dare look out the window,
for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison,
runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease
he has inherited the susceptibility to. He has to keep
his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers.
 
          If you catch him,
hold up a flashlight to his eye. It's all dark pupil,
an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens
as he stares back, and closes up the eye. Then from the lids
one tear, his only possession, like the bee's sting, slips.
Slyly he palms it, and if you're not paying attention
he'll swallow it. However, if you watch, he'll hand it over,

cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.

Dying (I heard a fly buzz when I died)
Emily Dickinson
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
Between the heaves of storm.
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset, when the king
Be witnessed in his power.
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
What portion of me I
Could make assignable, -- and then
There interposed a fly,
 
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
Between the light and me;
And then the windows failed, and then
I could not see to see.

Fame Speaks
Edward Estlin Cummings
Stand forth,John Keats!  On earth thou knew'st me not;
Steadfast through all the storms of passion,thou,
True to thy muse,and virgin to thy vow;
Resigned,if name with ashes were forgot,
So thou one arrow in the gold had'st shot!
I never placed my laurel on thy brow,
But on thy name I come to lay it now,
When thy bones wither in the earthly plot.
Fame is my name.  I dwell among the clouds,
Being immortal,and the wreath I bring
Itself is Immortality.  The sweets
Of earth I know not,more the pains,but wing
In mine own ether,with the crownéd crowds
Born of the centuries.-Stand forth,John Keats!

Elysium is as far as to

I Shall Go Back
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I shall go back again to the bleak shore
And build a little shanty on the sand
In such a way that the extremest band
Of brittle seaweed shall escape my door
But by a yard or two; and nevermore
Shall I return to take you by the hand.
I shall be gone to what I understand,
And happier than I ever was before.
The love that stood a moment in your eyes,
The words that lay a moment on your tongue,
Are one with all that in a moment dies,
A little under-said and over-sung.
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies
Unchanged from what they were when I was young.

The Seeing Eye
Ezra Pound
The small dogs look at the big dogs;
They observe unwieldy dimensions
And curious imperfections of odor.
Here is the formal male group:
The young men look upon their seniors,
They consider the elderly mind
And observe its inexplicable correlations.
 
Said Tsin-Tsu:
It is only in small dogs and the young
That we find minute observation

Lines Written In Recapitulation
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I could not bring this splendid world nor any trading beast
In charge of it, to defer, no, not to give ear, not in the least
Appearance, to my handsome prophecies,
which here I ponder and put by.
 
I am left simpler, less encumbered, by the consciousness
that I shall by no pebble in my dirty sling
avail To slay one purple giant four feet high and distribute arms
among his tall attendants, who spit at his name
when spitting on the ground:
They will be found one day Prone where they fell, or dead sitting
 -- and pock-marked wall
Supporting the beautiful back straight as an oak
before it is old.
 
I have learned to fail. And I have had my say.
Yet shall I sing until my voice crack
(this being my leisure, this my holiday)
That man was a special thing, and no commodity,
a thing improper to be sold.

The Black Art
Anne Sexton
A woman who writes feels too much,
those trances and portents!
As if cycles and children and islands
weren't enough; as if mourners and gossips
and vegetables were never enough.
She thinks she can warn the stars.
A writer is essentially a spy.
Dear love, I am that girl.
 
A man who writes knows too much,
such spells and fetiches!
As if erections and congresses and products
weren't enough; as if machines and galleons
and wars were never enough.
With used furniture he makes a tree.
A writer is essentially a crook.
Dear love, you are that man.
 
Never loving ourselves,
hating even our shoes and our hats,
we love each other, precious, precious.
Our hands are light blue and gentle.
Our eyes are full of terrible confessions.
But when we marry,
the children leave in disgust.
There is too much food and no one left over
to eat up all the weird abundance.

Oh, my belovèd, have you thought of this:
How in the years to come unscrupulous Time,
More cruel than Death, will tear you from my kiss,
And make you old, and leave me in my prime?
How you and I, who scale together yet
A little while the sweet, immortal height
No pilgrim may remember or forget,
As sure as the world turns, some granite night
Shall lie awake and know the gracious flame
Gone out forever on the mutual stone;
And call to mind that on the day you came
I was a child, and you a hero grown ?
And the night pass, and the strange morning break
Upon our anguish for each other's sake !

Buying The Whore
Anne Sexton
You are the roast beef I have purchased
and I stuff you with my very own onion.
 
You are a boat I have rented by the hour
and I steer you with my rage until you run aground.
 
You are a glass that I have paid to shatter
and I swallow the pieces down with my spit.
 
You are the grate I warm my trembling hands on,
searing the flesh until it's nice and juicy.
 
You stink like my Mama under your bra
and I vomit into your hand like a jackpot
its cold hard quarters.

Cosmopolitan Greetings
Allen Ginsberg
Stand up against governments, against God.
Stay irresponsible.
Say only what we know & imagine.
Absolutes are Coercion.
Change is absolute.
Ordinary mind includes eternal perceptions.
Observe what's vivid.
Notice what you notice.
Catch yourself thinking.
Vividness is self-selecting.
If we don't show anyone, we're free to write anything.
Remember the future.
Freedom costs little in the U.S.
Asvise only myself.
Don't drink yourself to death.
Two molecules clanking us against each other require an observer to become
scientific data.
The measuring instrument determines the appearance of the phenomenal
world (after Einstein).
The universe is subjective..
Walt Whitman celebrated Person.
We are observer, measuring instrument, eye, subject, Person.
Universe is Person.
Inside skull is vast as outside skull.
What's in between thoughts?
Mind is outer space.
What do we say to ourselves in bed at night, making no sound?
""First thought, best thought.?
Mind is shapely, Art is shapely.
Maximum information, minimum number of syllables.
Syntax condensed, sound is solid.
Intense fragments of spoken idiom, best.
Move with rhythm, roll with vowels.
Consonants around vowels make sense.
Savour vowels, appreciate consonants.
Subject is known by what she sees.
Others can measure their vision by what we see.
Candour ends paranoia.

After great pain, a formal feeling comes -- (341)
Emily Dickinson
After great pain, a formal feeling comes --
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs
The stiff Heart questions, was it He, that bore,
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?
 
The Feet, mechanical, go round --
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought --
A Wooden way
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone --
 
This is the Hour of Lead --
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow --
First -- Chill -- then Stupor -- then the letting go --

The Consecrating Mother
Anne Sexton
I stand before the sea
and it rolls and rolls in its green blood
saying, ""Do not give up one god
for I have a handful.""
The trade winds blew
in their twelve-fingered reversal
and I simply stood on the beach
while the ocean made a cross of salt
and hung up its drowned
and they cried Deo Deo.
The ocean offered them up in the vein of its might.
I wanted to share this
but I stood alone like a pink scarecrow.
 
The ocean steamed in and out,
the ocean gasped upon the shore
but I could not define her,
I could not name her mood, her locked-up faces.
Far off she rolled and rolled
like a woman in labor
and I thought of those who had crossed her,
in antiquity, in nautical trade, in slavery, in war.
I wondered how she had borne those bulwarks.
She should be entered skin to skin,
and put on like one's first or last cloth,
envered like kneeling your way into church,
descending into that ascension,
though she be slick as olive oil,
as she climbs each wave like an embezzler of white.
The big deep knows the law as it wears its gray hat,
though the ocean comes in its destiny,
with its one hundred lips,
and in moonlight she comes in her nudity,
flashing breasts made of milk-water,
flashing buttocks made of unkillable lust,
and at night when you enter her
you shine like a neon soprano.
 
I am that clumsy human
on the shore
loving you, coming, coming,
going,
and wish to put my thumb on you
like The Song of Solomon.

The Tree
Ezra Pound
I stood still and was a tree amid the wood,
Knowing the truth of things unseen before;
Of Daphne and the laurel bow
And that god-feasting couple old
that grew elm-oak amid the wold.
'Twas not until the gods had been
Kindly entreated, and been brought within
Unto the hearth of their heart's home
That they might do this wonder thing;
Nathless I have been a tree amid the wood
And many a new thing understood
That was rank folly to my head before.

Towards the Noel that morte saison
<i>(Christ make the shepherds' homage dear!)</i>
Then when the grey wolves everychone
Drink of the winds their chill small-beer
And lap o' the snows food's gueredon
Then makyth my heart his yule-tide cheer
<i>(Skoal! with the dregs if the clear be gone!)</i>
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.
 
Ask ye what ghost I dream upon?
<i>(What of the magians' scented gear?)</i>
The ghosts of dead loves everyone
That make the stark winds reek with fear
Lest love return with the foison sun
And slay the memories that me cheer
<i>(Such as I drink to mine fashion)</i>
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.
 
Where are the joys my heart had won?
<i>(Saturn and Mars to Zeus drawn near!)</i>
Where are athe lips mine lay upon,
Aye! where are the glances feat and clear
That bade my heart his valor don?
 
I skoal to the eyes as grey-blown meer
<i>(Who knows whose was that paragon?)</i>
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.

Nor what God hath that can me cheer
But ye ask first where the winds are gone
Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.

One Sweeps By
Walt Whitman
ONE sweeps by, attended by an immense train,
All emblematic of peace--not a soldier or menial among them.
 
One sweeps by, old, with black eyes, and profuse white hair,
He has the simple magnificence of health and strength,
His face strikes as with flashes of lightning whoever it turns
toward.
 
Three old men slowly pass, followed by three others, and they by
three others,
They are beautiful--the one in the middle of each group holds his
companions by the hand,
As they walk, they give out perfume wherever they walk.

Two Sisters of Persephone
Sylvia Plath
Two girls there are : within the house
One sits; the other, without.
Daylong a duet of shade and light
Plays between these.
 
In her dark wainscoted room
The first works problems on
A mathematical machine.
Dry ticks mark time
 
As she calculates each sum.
At this barren enterprise
Rat-shrewd go her squint eyes,
Root-pale her meager frame.
 
Bronzed as earth, the second lies,
Hearing ticks blown gold
Like pollen on bright air. Lulled
Near a bed of poppies,
 
She sees how their red silk flare
Of petaled blood
Burns open to the sun's blade.
On that green alter
 
Freely become sun's bride, the latter
Grows quick with seed.
Grass-couched in her labor's pride,
She bears a king. Turned bitter
 
And sallow as any lemon,
The other, wry virgin to the last,
Goes graveward with flesh laid waste,
Worm-husbanded, yet no woman.

Face Lift
Sylvia Plath
You bring me good news from the clinic,
Whipping off your silk scarf, exhibiting the tight white
Mummy-cloths, smiling: I'm all right.
When I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
Fed me banana-gas through a frog mask. The nauseous vault
Boomed with bad dreams and the Jovian voices of surgeons.
Then mother swam up, holding a tin basin.
O I was sick.
 
They've changed all that. Traveling
Nude as Cleopatra in my well-boiled hospital shift,
Fizzy with sedatives and unusually humorous,
I roll to an anteroom where a kind man
Fists my fingers for me. He makes me feel something precious
Is leaking from the finger-vents. At the count of two,
Darkness wipes me out like chalk on a blackboard. . .
I don't know a thing.
 
For five days I lie in secret,
Tapped like a cask, the years draining into my pillow.
Even my best friend thinks I'm in the country.
Skin doesn't have roots, it peels away easy as paper.
When I grin, the stitches tauten. I grow backward. I'm twenty,
Broody and in long skirts on my first husband's sofa, my fingers
Buried in the lambswool of the dead poodle;
I hadn't a cat yet.
 
Now she's done for, the dewlapped lady
I watched settle, line by line, in my mirror -- 
Old sock-face, sagged on a darning egg.
They've trapped her in some laboratory jar.
Let her die there, or wither incessantly for the next fifty years,
Nodding and rocking and fingering her thin hair.
Mother to myself, I wake swaddled in gauze,
Pink and smooth as a baby.

One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
 
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
 
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
In the sound of a few leaves,
 
Which is the sound of the land
Full of the same wind
That is blowing in the same bare place
For the listener, who listens in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.

Hard seeds of hate I planted
That should by now be grown, -- 
Rough stalks, and from thick stamens
A poisonous pollen blown,
And odors rank, unbreathable,
From dark corollas thrown!
 
At dawn from my damp garden
I shook the chilly dew;
The thin boughs locked behind me
That sprang to let me through;
The blossoms slept, -- I sought a place
Where nothing lovely grew.
 
And there, when day was breaking,
I knelt and looked around:
The light was near, the silence
Was palpitant with sound;
I drew my hate from out my breast
 
And thrust it in the ground.
 
Oh, ye so fiercely tended,
Ye little seeds of hate!
I bent above your growing
Early and noon and late,
Yet are ye drooped and pitiful, -- 
I cannot rear ye straight!
 
The sun seeks out my garden,
No nook is left in shade,
No mist nor mold nor mildew
Endures on any blade,
Sweet rain slants under every bough:
Ye falter, and ye fade.

Burnt Norton
Thomas Stearns Eliot
I
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation.
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose garden. My words echo
Thus, in your mind.
 
But to what purpose
Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves
I do not know.
 
Other echoes
Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?
Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,
Round the corner. Through the first gate,
Into our first world, shall we follow
The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.
There they were, dignified, invisible,
Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,
In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,
And the bird called, in response to
The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,
And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses
Had the look of flowers that are looked at.
They were there as our guests, accepted and accepting.
So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,
Along the empty alley, into the box circle,
To look down into the drained pool.
Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,
And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,
And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,
The surface glittered out of heart of light,
And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.
Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.
Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,
Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.
Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind
Cannot bear very much reality.
Time past and time future
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.

Garlic and sapphires in the mud
Clot the bedded axle-tree.
The trilling wire in the blood
Sings below inveterate scars
And reconciles forgotten wars.
The dance along the artery
The circulation of the lymph
Are figured in the drift of stars
Ascend to summer in the tree
We move above the moving tree
In light upon the figured leaf
And hear below the sodden floor
Below, the boarhound and the boar
Pursue their pattern as before
But reconciled among the stars.
 
At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,
But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.
 
The inner freedom from the practical desire,
The release from action and suffering, release from the inner
And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded
By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,
Ehrebung without motion, concentration
Without elimination, both a new world
And the old made explicit, understood
In the completion of its partial ecstasy,
The resolution of its partial horror.
Yet the enchainment of past and future
Woven in the weakness of the changing body,
Protects mankind from heaven and damnation
Which flesh cannot endure.
 
Time past and time future
Allow but a little consciousness.
To be conscious is not to be in time
But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,
The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,
The moment in the draughty church at smokefall
Be remembered; involved with past and future.
Only through time time is conquered.

Here is a place of disaffection
Time before and time after

In a dim light: neither daylight
Investing form with lucid stillness
Turning shadow into transient beauty
With a slow rotation suggesting permanence
Nor darkness to purify the soul
Emptying the sensual with deprivation
Cleansing affection from the temporal.
Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker
Over the strained time-ridden faces
Distracted from distraction by distraction
Filled with fancies and empty of meaning
Tumid apathy with no concentration
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind
That blows before and after time,
Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs
Time before and time after.
Eructation of unhealthy souls
Into the faded air, the torpid
Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,
Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,
Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here
Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.
 
Descend lower, descend only
Into the world of perpetual solitude,
World not world, but that which is not world,
Internal darkness, deprivation
And destitution of all property,
Desiccation of the world of sense,
Evacuation of the world of fancy,
In operancy of the world of spirit;
This is the one way, and the other
Is the same, not in movement
But abstention from movement; while the world moves
In appetency, on its metalled ways
Of time past and time future.

Time and the bell have buried the day,
The black cloud carries the sun away.
Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis
Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray
Clutch and cling?
Chill
Fingers of yew be curled
Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing
Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still
At the still point of the turning world.
 
V
Words move, music moves
Only in time; but that which is only living

Can only die. Words, after speech, reach
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,
Can words or music reach
The stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,
Not that only, but the co-existence,
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,
And the end and the beginning were always there
Before the beginning and after the end.
And all is always now. Words strain,
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
Will not stay still. Shrieking voices
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,
Always assail them. The Word in the desert
Is most attacked by voices of temptation,
The crying shadow in the funeral dance,
The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.
 
The detail of the pattern is movement,
As in the figure of the ten stairs.
Desire itself is movement
Not in itself undesirable;
Love is itself unmoving,
Only the cause and end of movement,
Timeless, and undesiring
Except in the aspect of time
Caught in the form of limitation
Between un-being and being.
Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
Even while the dust moves
There rises the hidden laughter
Of children in the foliage
Quick now, here, now, always -
Ridiculous the waste sad time
Stretching before and after.

Exiled
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Searching my heart for its true sorrow,
This is the thing I find to be:
That I am weary of words and people,
Sick of the city, wanting the sea;
 
Wanting the sticky, salty sweetness
Of the strong wind and shattered spray;
Wanting the loud sound and the soft sound
Of the big surf that breaks all day.
 
Always before about my dooryard,
Marking the reach of the winter sea,
Rooted in sand and dragging drift-wood,
Straggled the purple wild sweet-pea;
 
Always I climbed the wave at morning,
Shook the sand from my shoes at night,
That now am caught beneath great buildings,
Stricken with noise, confused with light.
 
If I could hear the green piles groaning
Under the windy wooden piers,
See once again the bobbing barrels,
And the black sticks that fence the weirs,
 
If I could see the weedy mussels
Crusting the wrecked and rotting hulls,
Hear once again the hungry crying
Overhead, of the wheeling gulls,
 
Feel once again the shanty straining
Under the turning of the tide,
Fear once again the rising freshet,
Dread the bell in the fog outside, -- 
 
I should be happy, -- that was happy
All day long on the coast of Maine!
I have a need to hold and handle
Shells and anchors and ships again!
 
I should be happy, that am happy
Never at all since I came here.
I am too long away from water.
I have a need of water near.

The Colder The Air
Elizabeth Bishop
We must admire her perfect aim,
this huntress of the winter air
whose level weapon needs no sight,
if it were not that everywhere
her game is sure, her shot is right.
The least of us could do the same.
 
The chalky birds or boats stand still,
reducing her conditions of chance;
air's gallery marks identically
the narrow gallery of her glance.
The target-center in her eye
is equally her aim and will.
 
Time's in her pocket, ticking loud
on one stalled second. She'll consult
not time nor circumstance. She calls
on atmosphere for her result.
(It is this clock that later falls
in wheels and chimes of leaf and cloud.)

Had I the Choice
Walt Whitman
Had I the choice to tally greatest bards,
To limn their portraits, stately, beautiful, and emulate at will,
Homer with all his wars and warriors--Hector, Achilles, Ajax,
Or Shakespeare's woe-entangled Hamlet, Lear, Othello--Tennyson's fair ladies,
Meter or wit the best, or choice conceit to weild in perfect rhyme, delight of singers;
These, these, O sea, all these I'd gladly barter,
Would you the undulation of one wave, its trick to me transfer,
Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse,
And leave its odor there.

Kindness
Sylvia Plath
Kindness glides about my house.
Dame Kindness, she is so nice!
The blue and red jewels of her rings smoke
In the windows, the mirrors
Are filling with smiles.
 
What is so real as the cry of a child?
A rabbit's cry may be wilder
But it has no soul.
Sugar can cure everything, so Kindness says.
Sugar is a necessary fluid,
Its crystals a little poultice.
 
O kindness, kindness
Sweetly picking up pieces!
My Japanese silks, desperate butterflies,
May be pinned any minute, anesthetized.
 
And here you come, with a cup of tea
Wreathed in steam.
The blood jet is poetry,
There is no stopping it.
You hand me two children, two roses.

Elegy Before Death
Edna St. Vincent Millay
There will be rose and rhododendron
When you are dead and under ground;
Still will be heard from white syringas
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
 
Still will the tamaracks be raining
After the rain has ceased, and still
Will there be robins in the stubble,
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
 
Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
Nothing will know that you are gone,
Saving alone some sullen plough-land
None but yourself sets foot upon;
 
Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
Nothing will know that you are dead, -- 
These, and perhaps a useless wagon
Standing beside some tumbled shed.
 
Oh, there will pass with your great passing
Little of beauty not your own, -- 
Only the light from common water,
Only the grace from simple stone!

Strayed Crab
Elizabeth Bishop
This is not my home. How did I get so far from water? It must
be over that way somewhere.
I am the color of wine, of tinta. The inside of my powerful
right claw is saffron-yellow. See, I see it now; I wave it like a
flag. I am dapper and elegant; I move with great precision,
cleverly managing all my smaller yellow claws. I believe in the
oblique, the indirect approach, and I keep my feelings to myself.
But on this strange, smooth surface I am making too much
noise. I wasn't meant for this. If I maneuver a bit and keep a
sharp lookout, I shall find my pool again. Watch out for my right
claw, all passersby! This place is too hard. The rain has stopped,
and it is damp, but still not wet enough to please me.
My eyes are good, though small; my shell is tough and tight.
In my own pool are many small gray fish. I see right through
them. Only their large eyes are opaque, and twitch at me. They
are hard to catch but I, I catch them quickly in my arms and
eat them up.
What is that big soft monster, like a yellow cloud, stifling
and warm? What is it doing? It pats my back. Out, claw. There,
I have frightened it away. It's sitting down, pretending nothing's
happened. I'll skirt it. It's still pretending not to see me. Out of
my way, O monster. I own a pool, all the little fish that swim in it,
and all the skittering waterbugs that smell like rotten apples.
Cheer up, O grievous snail. I tap your shell, encouragingly,
not that you will ever know about it.
And I want nothing to do with you, either, sulking toad.
Imagine, at least four times my size and yet so vulnerable... I
could open your belly with my claw. You glare and bulge, a
watchdog near my pool; you make a loud and hollow noise. I
do not care for such stupidity. I admire compression, lightness,
and agility, all rare in this loose world.

Renascence
Edna St. Vincent Millay
All I could see from where I stood
Was three long mountains and a wood;
I turned and looked another way,
And saw three islands in a bay.
So with my eyes I traced the line
Of the horizon, thin and fine,
Straight around till I was come
Back to where I'd started from;
And all I saw from where I stood
Was three long mountains and a wood.
Over these things I could not see;
These were the things that bounded me;
And I could touch them with my hand,
Almost, I thought, from where I stand.
And all at once things seemed so small
My breath came short, and scarce at all.
But, sure, the sky is big, I said;
Miles and miles above my head;
So here upon my back I'll lie
And look my fill into the sky.
And so I looked, and, after all,
The sky was not so very tall.
The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,
And -- sure enough! -- I see the top!
The sky, I thought, is not so grand;
I 'most could touch it with my hand!
And, reaching up my hand to try,
I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
 
I screamed, and -- lo! -- Infinity
Came down and settled over me;
And, pressing of the Undefined
The definition on my mind,
Held up before my eyes a glass
Through which my shrinking sight did pass
Until it seemed I must behold
Immensity made manifold;
Whispered to me a word whose sound
Deafened the air for worlds around,
And brought unmuffled to my ears
The gossiping of friendly spheres,
The creaking of the tented sky,
The ticking of Eternity.
I saw and heard, and knew at last
The How and Why of all things, past,
And present, and forevermore.
The universe, cleft to the core,
Lay open to my probing sense
That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence
But could not, -- nay! But needs must suck
At the great wound, and could not pluck
My lips away till I had drawn

All venom out. -- Ah, fearful pawn!
For my omniscience paid I toll
In infinite remorse of soul.
All sin was of my sinning, all
Atoning mine, and mine the gall
Of all regret. Mine was the weight
Of every brooded wrong, the hate
That stood behind each envious thrust,
Mine every greed, mine every lust.
And all the while for every grief,
Each suffering, I craved relief
With individual desire, --
Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
About a thousand people crawl;
Perished with each, -- then mourned for all!
A man was starving in Capri;
He moved his eyes and looked at me;
I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,
And knew his hunger as my own.
I saw at sea a great fog-bank
Between two ships that struck and sank;
A thousand screams the heavens smote;
And every scream tore through my throat.
No hurt I did not feel, no death
That was not mine; mine each last breath
That, crying, met an answering cry
From the compassion that was I.
All suffering mine, and mine its rod;
Mine, pity like the pity of God.
Ah, awful weight! Infinity
Pressed down upon the finite Me!
My anguished spirit, like a bird,
Beating against my lips I heard;
Yet lay the weight so close about
There was no room for it without.
And so beneath the Weight lay I
And suffered death, but could not die.
 
Long had I lain thus, craving death,
When quietly the earth beneath
Gave way, and inch by inch, so great
At last had grown the crushing weight,
Into the earth I sank till I
Full six feet under ground did lie,
And sank no more, -- there is no weight
Can follow here, however great.
From off my breast I felt it roll,
And as it went my tortured soul
Burst forth and fled in such a gust
That all about me swirled the dust.
 
Deep in the earth I rested now;

Cool is its hand upon the brow
And soft its breast beneath the head
Of one who is so gladly dead.
And all at once, and over all,
The pitying rain began to fall;
I lay and heard each pattering hoof
Upon my lowly, thatched roof,
And seemed to love the sound far more
Than ever I had done before.
For rain it hath a friendly sound
To one who's six feet underground;
And scarce the friendly voice or face:
A grave is such a quiet place.
 
The rain, I said, is kind to come
And speak to me in my new home.
I would I were alive again
To kiss the fingers of the rain,
To drink into my eyes the shine
Of every slanting silver line,
To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze
From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
For soon the shower will be done,
And then the broad face of the sun
Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
Until the world with answering mirth
Shakes joyously, and each round drop
Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.
How can I bear it; buried here,
While overhead the sky grows clear
And blue again after the storm?
O, multi-colored, multiform,
Beloved beauty over me,
That I shall never, never see
Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,
That I shall never more behold!
Sleeping your myriad magics through,
Close-sepulchred away from you!
O God, I cried, give me new birth,
And put me back upon the earth!
Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd
And let the heavy rain, down-poured
In one big torrent, set me free,
Washing my grave away from me!
 
I ceased; and, through the breathless hush
That answered me, the far-off rush
Of herald wings came whispering
Like music down the vibrant string
Of my ascending prayer, and -- crash!
Before the wild wind's whistling lash
The startled storm-clouds reared on high

And plunged in terror down the sky,
And the big rain in one black wave
Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
 
I know not how such things can be
I only know there came to me
A fragrance such as never clings
To aught save happy living things;
A sound as of some joyous elf
Singing sweet songs to please himself,
And, through and over everything,
A sense of glad awakening.
The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,
Whispering to me I could hear;
I felt the rain's cool finger-tips
Brushed tenderly across my lips,
Laid gently on my sealed sight,
And all at once the heavy night
Fell from my eyes and I could see, --
A drenched and dripping apple-tree,
A last long line of silver rain,
A sky grown clear and blue again.
And as I looked a quickening gust
Of wind blew up to me and thrust
Into my face a miracle
Of orchard-breath, and with the smell, --
I know not how such things can be! --
I breathed my soul back into me.
Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
And hailed the earth with such a cry
As is not heard save from a man
Who has been dead, and lives again.
About the trees my arms I wound;
Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
I raised my quivering arms on high;
I laughed and laughed into the sky,
Till at my throat a strangling sob
Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb
Sent instant tears into my eyes;
O God, I cried, no dark disguise
Can e'er hereafter hide from me
Thy radiant identity!
Thou canst not move across the grass
But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,
Nor speak, however silently,
But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
I know the path that tells Thy way
Through the cool eve of every day;
God, I can push the grass apart
And lay my finger on Thy heart!
 
The world stands out on either side

No wider than the heart is wide;
Above the world is stretched the sky, --
No higher than the soul is high.
The heart can push the sea and land
Farther away on either hand;
The soul can split the sky in two,
And let the face of God shine through.
But East and West will pinch the heart
That cannot keep them pushed apart;
And he whose soul is flat -- the sky
Will cave in on him by and by.

A Hunger So Honed
Tracy K Smith
Driving home late through town
He woke me for a deer in the road,
The light smudge of it fragile in the distance,

Free in a way that made me ashamed for our flesh--
His hand on my hand, even the weight
Of our voices not speaking.

I watched a long time
And a long time after we were too far to see,
Told myself I still saw it nosing the shrubs,

All phantom and shadow, so silent
It must have seemed I hadn't wakened,
But passed into a deeper, more cogent state of dream--

The mind a dark city, a disappearing,
A handkerchief
Swallowed by a fist.

I thought of the animal's mouth
And the hunger entrusted it. A hunger
So honed the green leaves merely maintain it.

We want so much,
When perhaps we live best
In the spaces between loves,

That unconscious roving,
The heart its own rough animal.
Unfettered.


The second time,
There were two that faced us a moment
The way deer will in their Greek perfection,

As though we were just some offering
The night had delivered.
They disappeared between two houses,

And we drove on, our own limbs
Sloppy after that, our need for one another
Greedy, weak

As I lay with my head in your lap, camerado,
The confession I made I resume -- what I said to you in the open air I resume:
I know I am restless, and make others so;
I know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death;
For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them;
I am more resolute because all have denied me, than I could ever have been had all
accepted me;
I heed not, and have never heeded eiher experience, cautions, majorities, or
ridicule;
And the threat of what is called hell is little or nothing to me;
And the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me;
Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still urge you,
without the least idea what is our destination,
Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quelled and defeated.

army or a city, or to write a book--perhaps more,
The youth, the laboring person, the poor person, rivalling all the
rest--perhaps outdoing the rest,
The effects of the universe no greater than its;
For there is nothing in the whole universe that can be more effective
than a man's or woman's daily behavior can be,
In any position, in any one of These States.

Into bloated faces.
She’d like to swat at them

She considers her hands, at rest
Like pale fruits in her lap. Should she
Gather them in her skirt and hurry
Down the tree in reverse, greedy
For a vivid mouthful of something
Sweet? The sun gets brighter
As it drops low. Soon the room
Will glow gold with late afternoon.
Still no husband, face creased from sleep,
His one bag across his chest. Soon
The windows will grow black. Still
No one with his hand always returning
To the hollow below her back.

As it surrenders its drunks to the night.
It is the drunks on ancient bicycles
Warbling into motionless air,
And the pigeons, asleep in branches,
That will repeat the same songs tomorrow

Awake now over a bowl of ashes

With a cigarette that burns

Is really Asparagus. That's such a fuss
To pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus.
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake,
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake.
Yet he was, in his youth, quite the smartest of Cats -
But no longer a terror to mice and to rats.
For he isn't the Cat that he was in his prime;
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in its time.
And whenever he joins his friends at their club
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays,
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days.
For he once was a Star of the highest degree -
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree.
And he likes to relate his success on the Halls,
Where the Gallery once gave him seven cat-calls.
But his grandest creation, as he loves to tell,
Was Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.
 
`I have played', so he says, `every possible part,
And I used to know seventy speeches by heart.
I'd extemporize back-chat, I knew how to gag,
And I know how to let the cat out of the bag.
I knew how to act with my back and my tail;
With an hour of rehearsal, I never could fail.
I'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts,
Whether I took the lead, or in character parts.
I have sat by the bedside of poor Little Nell;
When the Curfew was rung, then I swung on the bell.
In the Pantomime season I never fell flat
And I once understudied Dick Whittington's Cat.
But my grandest creation, as history will tell,
Was Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.'
 
Then, if someone will give him a toothful of gin,
He will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne.
At a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat,
When some actor suggested the need for a cat.
He once played a Tiger - could do it again -
Which an Indian Colonel pursued down a drain.
And he thinks that he still can, much better than most,
Produce blood-curdling noises to bring on the Ghost.
And he once crossed the stage on a telegraph wire,
To rescue a child when a house was on fire.
And he says: `Now, these kittens, they do not get trained
As we did in the days when Victoria reigned.
They never get drilled in a regular troupe,
And they think they are smart, just to jump through a hoop.'
And he'll say, as he scratches himself with his claws,
`Well, the Theatre's certainly not what it was.

These modern productions are all very well,
But there's nothing to equal, from what I hear tell,
That moment of mystery
When I made history
As Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.'

In White
Robert Frost
A dented spider like a snow drop white
On a white Heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
Portent in little, assorted death and blight
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
The beady spider, the flower like a froth,
And the moth carried like a paper kite.
What had that flower to do with being white,
The blue prunella every child's delight.
What brought the kindred spider to that height?
(Make we no thesis of the miller's plight.)
What but design of darkness and of night?
Design, design! Do I use the word aright?

Poem With Refrains
Robert Pinsky
The opening scene. The yellow, coal-fed fog
Uncurling over the tainted city river,
A young girl rowing and her anxious father
Scavenging for corpses. Funeral meats. The clever
Abandoned orphan. The great athletic killer
Sulking in his tent. As though all stories began
With someone dying.
 
When her mother died,
My mother refused to attend the funeral--
In fact, she sulked in her tent all through the year
Of the old lady's dying. I don't know why:
She said, because she loved her mother so much
She couldn't bear to see the way the doctors,
Or her father, or--someone--was letting her mother die.
""Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;
Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.""
 
She fogs things up, she scavenges the taint.
Possibly that's the reason I write these poems.
 
But they did speak: on the phone. Wept and argued,
So fiercely one or the other often cut off
A sentence by hanging up in rage--like lovers,
But all that year she never saw her face.
 
They lived on the same block, four doors apart.
""Absence my presence is; strangeness my grace;
With them that walk against me is my sun.""
 
""Synagogue"" is a word I never heard,
We called it shul, the Yiddish word for school.
Elms, terra-cotta, the ocean a few blocks east.
""Lay institution"": she taught me we didn't think
God lived in it. The rabbi is just a teacher.
 
But what about the hereditary priests,
Descendants of the Cohanes of the Temple,
Like Walter Holtz--I called him Uncle Walter,
When I was small. A big man with a face
Just like a boxer dog or a cartoon sergeant.
She told me whenever he helped a pretty woman
Try on a shoe in his store, he'd touch her calf
And ask her, ""How does that feel?"" I was too little
To get the point but pretended to understand.
""Desire, be steady; hope is your delight,
An orb wherein no creature can ever be sorry.""
 
She didn't go to my bar mitzvah, either.
I can't say why: she was there, and then she wasn't.
I looked around before I mounted the steps
To chant that babble and the speech the rabbi wrote

And there she wasn't, and there was Uncle Walter
The Cohane frowning with his doggy face:
""She's missing her own son's musaf."" Maybe she just
Doesn't like rituals. Afterwards, she had a reason
I don't remember. I wasn't upset: the truth
Is, I had decided to be the clever orphan
Some time before. By now, it's all a myth.
What is a myth but something that seems to happen
Always for the first time over and over again?
And ten years later, she missed my brother's, too.
I'm sorry: I think it was something about a hat.
""Hot sun, cool fire, tempered with sweet air,
Black shade, fair nurse, shadow my white hair;
Shine, sun; burn, fire; breathe, air, and ease me.""
 
She sees the minister of the Nation of Islam
On television, though she's half-blind in one eye.
His bow tie is lime, his jacket crocodile green.
Vigorously he denounces the Jews who traded in slaves,
The Jews who run the newspapers and the banks.
""I see what this guy is mad about now,"" she says,
""It must have been some Jew that sold him the suit.""
""And the same wind sang and the same wave whitened,
And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,
In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened.""
 
But when they unveiled her mother's memorial stone,
Gathered at the graveside one year after the death,
According to custom, while we were standing around
About to begin the prayers, her car appeared.
It was a black car; the ground was deep in snow.
My mother got out and walked toward us, across
The field of gravestones capped with snow, her coat
Black as the car, and they waited to start the prayers
Until she arrived. I think she enjoyed the drama.
I can't remember if she prayed or not,
But that may be the way I'll remember her best:
Dark figure, awaited, attended, aware, apart.
""The present time upon time pass&euml;d striketh;
With Phoebus's wandering course the earth is graced.
 
The air still moves, and by its moving, cleareth;
The fire up ascends, and planets feedeth;
The water passeth on, and all lets weareth;
The earth stands still, yet change of changes breedeth.""

Out of the Rolling Ocean, The Crowd
Walt Whitman
OUT of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,
Whispering, I love you, before long I die,
I have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you,
For I could not die till I once look'd on you,
For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.
 
(Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe;
Return in peace to the ocean, my love;
I too am part of that ocean, my love--we are not so much separated;
Behold the great rondure--the cohesion of all, how perfect!
But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us, 
As for an hour, carrying us diverse--yet cannot carry us diverse for
ever;
Be not impatient--a little space--Know you, I salute the air, the
ocean and the land,
Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.)

I Saw Old General At Bay

I SAW old General at bay;
(Old as he was, his grey eyes yet shone out in battle like stars;)
His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works;
He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines--a desperate
emergency;
I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks--but two or three
were selected;
I saw them receive their orders aside--they listen'd with care--the
adjutant was very grave;
I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.

When the Year grows Old
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I cannot but remember
When the year grows old --
October -- November --
How she disliked the cold!
 
She used to watch the swallows
Go down across the sky,
And turn from the window
With a little sharp sigh.
 
And often when the brown leaves
Were brittle on the ground,
And the wind in the chimney
Made a melancholy sound,
 
She had a look about her
That I wish I could forget --
The look of a scared thing
Sitting in a net!
 
Oh, beautiful at nightfall
The soft spitting snow!
And beautiful the bare boughs
Rubbing to and fro!
 
But the roaring of the fire,
And the warmth of fur,
And the boiling of the kettle
Were beautiful to her!
 
I cannot but remember
When the year grows old --
October -- November --
How she disliked the cold!

The Gum-Gatherer
Robert Frost
There overtook me and drew me in
To his down-hill, early-morning stride,
And set me five miles on my road
Better than if he had had me ride,
A man with a swinging bag for'load
And half the bag wound round his hand.
We talked like barking above the din
Of water we walked along beside.
And for my telling him where I'd been
And where I lived in mountain land
To be coming home the way I was,
He told me a little about himself.
He came from higher up in the pass
Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
Is blocks split off the mountain mass --
And hop. eless grist enough it looks
Ever to grind to soil for grass.
(The way it is will do for moss.)
There he had built his stolen shack.
It had to be a stolen shack
Because of the fears of fire and logs
That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:
Visions of half the world burned black
And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.
We know who when they come to town
Bring berries under the wagon seat,
Or a basket of eggs between their feet;
What this man brought in a cotton sack
Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
Like uncut jewels, dull and rough
It comes to market golden brown;
But turns to pink between the teeth.
I told him this is a pleasant life
To set your breast to the bark of trees
That all your days are dim beneath,
And reaching up with a little knife,
To loose the resin and take it down
And bring it to market when you please

Rowing
Anne Sexton
A story, a story!
(Let it go. Let it come.)
I was stamped out like a Plymouth fender
into this world.
First came the crib
with its glacial bars.
Then dolls
and the devotion to their plactic mouths.
Then there was school,
the little straight rows of chairs,
blotting my name over and over,
but undersea all the time,
a stranger whose elbows wouldn't work.
Then there was life
with its cruel houses
and people who seldom touched-
though touch is all-
but I grew,
like a pig in a trenchcoat I grew,
and then there were many strange apparitions,
the nagging rain, the sun turning into poison
and all of that, saws working through my heart,
but I grew, I grew,
and God was there like an island I had not rowed to,
still ignorant of Him, my arms, and my legs worked,
and I grew, I grew,
I wore rubies and bought tomatoes
and now, in my middle age,
about nineteen in the head I'd say,
I am rowing, I am rowing
though the oarlocks stick and are rusty
and the sea blinks and rolls
like a worried eyebal,
but I am rowing, I am rowing,
though the wind pushes me back
and I know that that island will not be perfect,
it will have the flaws of life,
the absurdities of the dinner table,
but there will be a door
and I will open it
and I will get rid of the rat insdie me,
the gnawing pestilential rat.
God will take it with his two hands
and embrace it.
 
As the African says:
This is my tale which I have told,
if it be sweet, if it be not sweet,
take somewhere else and let some return to me.
This story ends with me still rowing.

I Dreamed I Moved Among The Elysian Fields

I dreamed I moved among the Elysian fields,
In converse with sweet women long since dead;
And out of blossoms which that meadow yields
I wove a garland for your living head.
Danai, that was the vessel for a day
Of golden Jove, I saw, and at her side,
Whom Jove the Bull desired and bore away,
Europa stood, and the Swan's featherless bride.
All these were mortal women, yet all these
Above the ground had had a god for guest;
Freely I walked beside them and at ease,
Addressing them, by them again addressed,
And marvelled nothing, for remembering you,
Wherefore I was among them well I knew.

To shut the Door And it went out
And I am all alone--
 
If I could find it Anywhere
I would not mind the journey there
Though it took all my store
 
But just to look it in the Eye--
""Did'st thou?"" ""Thou did'st not mean,"" to say,
Then, turn my Face away.

Crossing Brooklyn Ferry
Walt Whitman
FLOOD-TIDE below me! I watch you face to face;
Clouds of the west! sun there half an hour high! I see you also face
to face.
 
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes! how curious
you are to me!
On the ferry-boats, the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning
home, are more curious to me than you suppose;
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence, are more to
me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.
 
The impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the
day;
The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme--myself disintegrated, every
one disintegrated, yet part of the scheme:
The similitudes of the past, and those of the future;
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings--on
the walk in the street, and the passage over the river;
The current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away; 
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them;
The certainty of others--the life, love, sight, hearing of others.
 
Others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to
shore;
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide;
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the
heights of Brooklyn to the south and east;
Others will see the islands large and small;
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half
an hour high;
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others
will see them,
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring in of the flood-tide, the falling
back to the sea of the ebb-tide.
 
It avails not, neither time or place--distance avails not; 
I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many
generations hence;
I project myself--also I return--I am with you, and know how it is.
 
Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt;
Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd;
Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the bright
flow, I was refresh'd;
Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift
current, I stood, yet was hurried;
Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the thick-
stem'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.

I too many and many a time cross'd the river, the sun half an hour
high;
I watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls--I saw them high in the air,
floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,
I saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and
left the rest in strong shadow, 
I saw the slow-wheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the
south.
 
I too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light around the shape of my
head in the sun-lit water,
Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,
Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,
Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops--saw the ships at anchor,
The sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars, 
The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender
serpentine pennants,
The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-
houses,
The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the
wheels,
The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sun-set,
The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the
frolicsome crests and glistening,
The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the
granite store-houses by the docks,
On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on
each side by the barges--the hay-boat, the belated lighter,
On the neighboring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning
high and glaringly into the night,
Casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow
light, over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of
streets.
 
These, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you; 
I project myself a moment to tell you--also I return.
 
I loved well those cities;
I loved well the stately and rapid river;
The men and women I saw were all near to me;
Others the same--others who look back on me, because I look'd forward
to them;
(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)
 
What is it, then, between us?
What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?

Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails
not.
 
I too lived--Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine; 
I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the
waters around it;
I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,
In the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,
In my walks home late at night, or as I lay in my bed, they came upon
me.
 
I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution;
I too had receiv'd identity by my Body;
That I was, I knew was of my body--and what I should be, I knew I
should be of my body.
 
It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
The dark threw patches down upon me also;
The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious; 
My great thoughts, as I supposed them, were they not in reality
meagre? would not people laugh at me?
 
It is not you alone who know what it is to be evil;
I am he who knew what it was to be evil;
I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,
Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,
Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant;
The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,
The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not
wanting,
Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these
wanting. 
 
But I was Manhattanese, friendly and proud!
I was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as
they saw me approaching or passing,
Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of
their flesh against me as I sat,
Saw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public assembly,
yet never told them a word,
Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,
sleeping,
Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,
The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we
like,
Or as small as we like, or both great and small.

Closer yet I approach you;
What thought you have of me, I had as much of you--I laid in my
stores in advance; 
I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.
 
Who was to know what should come home to me?
Who knows but I am enjoying this?
Who knows but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot
see me?
 
It is not you alone, nor I alone;
Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;
It is that each came, or comes, or shall come, from its due emission,
From the general centre of all, and forming a part of all:
Everything indicates--the smallest does, and the largest does;
A necessary film envelopes all, and envelopes the Soul for a proper
time. 
 
Now I am curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable to
me than my mast-hemm'd Manhattan,
My river and sun-set, and my scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide,
The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight,
and the belated lighter;
Curious what Gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and
with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest
name as I approach;
Curious what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or
man that looks in my face,
Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you.
 
We understand, then, do we not?
What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?
What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not
accomplish, is accomplish'd, is it not?
What the push of reading could not start, is started by me
personally, is it not? 
 
Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!
Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!
Gorgeous clouds of the sun-set! drench with your splendor me, or the
men and women generations after me;
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta!--stand up, beautiful hills of
Brooklyn!
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street, or public
assembly!
Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my

nighest name!
Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or
actress! 
Play the old role, the role that is great or small, according as one
makes it!
 
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be
looking upon you;
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet
haste with the hasting current;
Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in
the air;
Receive the summer sky, you water! and faithfully hold it, till all
downcast eyes have time to take it from you;
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any
one's head, in the sun-lit water;
Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd
schooners, sloops, lighters!
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset;
Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at
nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the
houses;
Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are; 
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul;
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest
aromas;
Thrive, cities! bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and
sufficient rivers;
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual;
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.
 
We descend upon you and all things--we arrest you all;
We realize the soul only by you, you faithful solids and fluids;
Through you color, form, location, sublimity, ideality;
Through you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and
determinations of ourselves.
 
You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers! you
novices! 
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate
henceforward;
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves

We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently
within us;
We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also;
You furnish your parts toward eternity;
Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.

LO! Victress on the peaks!
Where thou, with mighty brow, regarding the world,
(The world, O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee;)
Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all;
Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,
Flauntest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and bloom--lo! in these

No poem proud, I, chanting, bring to thee--nor mastery's rapturous

But a book, containing night's darkness, and blood-dripping wounds,
And psalms of the dead.

The River-Merchant's Wife: A Letter (translation of Li Po)
Ezra Pound 
While my hair was still cut straight
     across my forehead
I played at the front gate, pulling
     flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing
     horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with
     blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of
     Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or
     suspicion.
 
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never
     looked back.
 
At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with
     yours
Forever and forever and forever.
Why should I climb the lookout?
 
At sixteen you departed,
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river
     of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise
     overhead.
 
You dragged your feet when you went
     out,
By the gate now, the moss is grown,
     the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in
     wind.
The paired butterflies are already
     yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.  I grow older.
If you are coming down through the
     narrows of the river Kiang,
Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you
          As far as Cho-fu-sa.

Ethiopia Saluting The Colors
Walt Whitman
WHO are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,
With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet?
Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?
 
('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sand and pines,
Forth from thy hovel door, thou, Ethiopia, com'st to me,
As, under doughty Sherman, I march toward the sea.)
 
Me, master, years a hundred, since from my parents sunder'd,
A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught;
Then hither me, across the sea, the cruel slaver brought.
 
No further does she say, but lingering all the day, 
Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,
And curtseys to the regiments, the guidons moving by.
 
What is it, fateful woman--so blear, hardly human?
Why wag your head, with turban bound--yellow, red and green?
Are the things so strange and marvelous, you see or have seen?

The Death King
Anne Sexton
I hired a carpenter
to build my coffin
and last night I lay in it,
braced by a pillow,
sniffing the wood,
letting the old king
breathe on me,
thinking of my poor murdered body,
murdered by time,
waiting to turn stiff as a field marshal,
letting the silence dishonor me,
remembering that I'll never cough again.
 
Death will be the end of fear
and the fear of dying,
fear like a dog stuffed in my mouth,
feal like dung stuffed up my nose,
fear where water turns into steel,
fear as my breast flies into the Disposall,
fear as flies tremble in my ear,
fear as the sun ignites in my lap,
fear as night can't be shut off,
and the dawn, my habitual dawn,
is locked up forever.
 
Fear and a coffin to lie in
like a dead potato.
Even then I will dance in my dire clothes,
a crematory flight,
blinding my hair and my fingers,
wounding God with his blue face,
his tyranny, his absolute kingdom,
with my aphrodisiac.

Virgin in a Tree
Sylvia Plath
How this tart fable instructs
And mocks! Here's the parody of that moral mousetrap
Set in the proverbs stitched on samplers
Approving chased girls who get them to a tree
And put on bark's nun-black
 
Habit which deflects
All amorous arrows. For to sheathe the virgin shape
In a scabbard of wood baffles pursuers,
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first Daphne
Switched her incomparable back
 
For a bay-tree hide, respect's
Twined to her hard limbs like ivy: the puritan lip
Cries: 'Celebrate Syrinx whose demurs
Won her the frog-colored skin, pale pith and watery
Bed of a reed. Look:
 
Pine-needle armor protects
Pitys from Pan's assault! And though age drop
Their leafy crowns, their fame soars,
Eclipsing Eva, Cleo and Helen of Troy:
For which of those would speak
 
For a fashion that constricts
White bodies in a wooden girdle, root to top
Unfaced, unformed, the nipple-flowers
Shrouded to suckle darkness? Only they
Who keep cool and holy make
 
A sanctum to attract
Green virgins, consecrating limb and lip
To chastity's service: like prophets, like preachers,
They descant on the serene and seraphic beauty
Of virgins for virginity's sake.'
 
Be certain some such pact's
Been struck to keep all glory in the grip
Of ugly spinsters and barren sirs
As you etch on the inner window of your eye
This virgin on her rack:
 
She, ripe and unplucked, 's
Lain splayed too long in the tortuous boughs: overripe
Now, dour-faced, her fingers
Stiff as twigs, her body woodenly
Askew, she'll ache and wake
 
Though doomsday bud. Neglect's
Given her lips that lemon-tasting droop:
Untongued, all beauty's bright juice sours.
Tree-twist will ape this gross anatomy

Till irony's bough break.

Out of geraniums and unsmelled flowers.

As small as fish-eggs.

Will abash him.

Manuelzinho
Elizabeth Bishop
[Brazil. A friend of the writer is speaking.]
 
Half squatter, half tenant (no rent)—
a sort of inheritance; white,
in your thirties now, and supposed
to supply me with vegetables,
but you don't; or you won't; or you can't
get the idea through your brain—
the world's worst gardener since Cain.
Titled above me, your gardens
ravish my eyes. You edge
the beds of silver cabbages
with red carnations, and lettuces
mix with alyssum. And then
umbrella ants arrive,
or it rains for a solid week
and the whole thing's ruined again
and I buy you more pounds of seeds,
imported, guaranteed,
and eventually you bring me
a mystic thee-legged carrot,
or a pumpkin ""bigger than the baby.""
 
I watch you through the rain,
trotting, light, on bare feet,
up the steep paths you have made—
or your father and grandfather made—
all over my property,
with your head and back inside
a sodden burlap bag,
and feel I can't endure it
another minute; then,
indoors, beside the stove,
keep on reading a book.
 
You steal my telephone wires,
or someone does. You starve
your horse and yourself
and your dogs and family.
among endless variety,
you eat boiled cabbage stalks.
And once I yelled at you
so loud to hurry up
and fetch me those potatoes
your holey hat flew off,
you jumped out of your clogs,
leaving three objects arranged
in a triangle at my feet,
as if you'd been a gardener
in a fairy tale all this time
and at the word ""potatoes""

had vanished to take up your work
of fairy prince somewhere.
 
The strangest things happen to you.
Your cows eats a ""poison grass""
and drops dead on the spot.
Nobody else's does.
And then your father dies,
a superior old man
with a black plush hat, and a moustache
like a white spread-eagled sea gull.
The family gathers, but you,
no, you ""don't think he's dead!
I look at him. He's cold.
They're burying him today.
But you know, I don't think he's dead.""
I give you money for the funeral
and you go and hire a bus
for the delighted mourners,
so I have to hand over some more
and then have to hear you tell me
you pray for me every night!
 
And then you come again,
sniffing and shivering,
hat in hand, with that wistful
face, like a child's fistful
of bluets or white violets,
improvident as the dawn,
and once more I provide
for a shot of penicillin
down at the pharmacy, or
one more bottle of
Electrical Baby Syrup.
Or, briskly, you come to settle
what we call our ""accounts,""
with two old copybooks,
one with flowers on the cover,
the other with a camel.
immediate confusion.
You've left out decimal points.
Your columns stagger,
honeycombed with zeros.
You whisper conspiratorially;
the numbers mount to millions.
Account books? They are Dream Books.
in the kitchen we dream together
how the meek shall inherit the earth—
or several acres of mine.
 
With blue sugar bags on their heads,
carrying your lunch,

your children scuttle by me
like little moles aboveground,
or even crouch behind bushes
as if I were out to shoot them!
—Impossible to make friends,
though each will grab at once
for an orange or a piece of candy.
 
Twined in wisps of fog,
I see you all up there
along with Formoso, the donkey,
who brays like a pump gone dry,
then suddenly stops.
—All just standing, staring
off into fog and space.
Or coming down at night,
in silence, except for hoofs,
in dim moonlight, the horse
or Formoso stumbling after.
Between us float a few
big, soft, pale-blue,
sluggish fireflies,
the jellyfish of the air...
 
Patch upon patch upon patch,
your wife keeps all of you covered.
She has gone over and over
(forearmed is forewarned)
your pair of bright-blue pants
with white thread, and these days
your limbs are draped in blueprints.
You paint—heaven knows why—
the outside of the crown
and brim of your straw hat.
Perhaps to reflect the sun?
Or perhaps when you were small,
your mother said, ""Manuelzinho,
one thing; be sure you always
paint your straw hat.""
One was gold for a while,
but the gold wore off, like plate.
One was bright green. Unkindly,
I called you Klorophyll Kid.
My visitors thought it was funny.
I apologize here and now.
You helpless, foolish man,
I love you all I can,
I think. Or I do?
I take off my hat, unpainted
and figurative, to you.
Again I promise to try.

Doctors

and penicillin
They work with gentleness
and the scalpel.
They dig out the cancer,
close an incision
and say a prayer
to the poverty of the skin.
They are not Gods
though they would like to be;
they are only a human
trying to fix up a human.
Many humans die.
They die like the tender,
palpitating berries
in November.
But all along the doctors remember:
First do no harm.
They would kiss if it would heal.
It would not heal.
 
If the doctors cure
then the sun sees it.
If the doctors kill
then the earth hides it.
The doctors should fear arrogance
more than cardiac arrest.
If they are too proud,
and some are,
then they leave home on horseback
but God returns them on foot.

But in twenty-five years she'll be silver,
In fifty, gold.

They throw a forest down less cut than broken.

Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought
But in no hush they string it: they go past
With shouts afar to pull the cable taught,
To hold it hard until they make it fast,
To ease away -- they have it. With a laugh,
An oath of towns that set the wild at naught
They bring the telephone and telegraph.

It gave back too.

of interrupting water comes and goes
and glazes over his dark and brittle feet.
He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.
 
- Watching, rather, the spaces of sand between them
where (no detail too small) the Atlantic drains
rapidly backwards and downwards. As he runs,
he stares at the dragging grains.
 
The world is a mist. And then the world is
minute and vast and clear. The tide
is higher or lower. He couldn't tell you which.
His beak is focussed; he is preoccupied,

Even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table.
 
It reminded him how he had needed
A place to go to in his own direction,
 
How he had recomposed the pines,
Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds,
 
For the outlook that would be right,
Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion:

Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged,
 
Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea,
Recognize his unique and solitary home.

People say only good things about Christmas.
If they want to say something bad,
they whisper.
So I went to the well and drew a baby
out of the hollow water.
Then God spoke to me and said:
Here. Take this gingerbread lady
and put her in your oven.
When the cow gives blood
and the Christ is born
we must all eat sacrifices.
We must all eat beautiful women.

It is himself he guides
 
In among these silk
Screens, these rustling appurtenances.

Attendants of the eyelash!
I shall unloose
One feather, like the peacock.

Attendants of the lip!
I shall unloose

Shattering

Of air that all day flies
 
Its crystals
A million ignorants.

Doll he guards like a heart --
 
The lioness,
The shriek in the bath,
The cloak of holes.

Old goatherds swear how all night long they hear
The warning whirr and burring of the bird

Vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder.

Dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered
By claw-cuts of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
Its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire.
 
So fables say the Goatsucker moves, masked from men's sight
In an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth,
Well-named, ill-famed a knavish fly-by-night,
Yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death
And shadows only--cave-mouth bristle beset--
Cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth.

Put on a clean shirt

Nothing with drool, please,

no sweat, no sperm.
You want me clean, God,
so I'll try to comply.
 
The hat I was married in,
will it do?
White, broad, fake flowers in a tiny array.
It's old-fashioned, as stylish as a bedbug,
but is suits to die in something nostalgic.
 
And I'll take
my painting shirt
washed over and over of course
spotted with every yellow kitchen I've painted.
God, you don't mind if I bring all my kitchens?
They hold the family laughter and the soup.
 
For a bra
(need we mention it?),
the padded black one that my lover demeaned
when I took it off.
He said, ""Where'd it all go?""
 
And I'll take
the maternity skirt of my ninth month,
a window for the love-belly
that let each baby pop out like and apple,
the water breaking in the restaurant,
making a noisy house I'd like to die in.
 
For underpants I'll pick white cotton,
the briefs of my childhood,
for it was my mother's dictum
that nice girls wore only white cotton.
If my mother had lived to see it
she would have put a WANTED sign up in the post office
for the black, the red, the blue I've worn.
Still, it would be perfectly fine with me
to die like a nice girl
smelling of Clorox and Duz.
Being sixteen-in-the-pants
I would die full of questions.

Transcription of Organ Music
Allen Ginsberg
The flower in the glass peanut bottle formerly in the
kitchen crooked to take a place in the light,
the closet door opened, because I used it before, it
kindly stayed open waiting for me, its owner.
 
I began to feel my misery in pallet on floor, listening
to music, my misery, that's why I want to sing.
The room closed down on me, I expected the presence
of the Creator, I saw my gray painted walls and
ceiling, they contained my room, they contained
me
as the sky contained my garden,
I opened my door
 
The rambler vine climbed up the cottage post,
the leaves in the night still where the day had placed
them, the animal heads of the flowers where they had
arisen
to think at the sun
 
Can I bring back the words? Will thought of
transcription haze my mental open eye?
The kindly search for growth, the gracious de-
sire to exist of the flowers, my near ecstasy at existing
among them
The privilege to witness my existence-you too
must seek the sun...
 
My books piled up before me for my use
waiting in space where I placed them, they
haven't disappeared, time's left its remnants and qual-
ities for me to use--my words piled up, my texts, my
manuscripts, my loves.
I had a moment of clarity, saw the feeling in
the heart of things, walked out to the garden crying.
Saw the red blossoms in the night light, sun's
gone, they had all grown, in a moment, and were wait-
ing stopped in time for the day sun to come and give
them...
Flowers which as in a dream at sunset I watered
faithfully not knowing how much I loved them.
I am so lonely in my glory--except they too out
there--I looked up--those red bush blossoms beckon-
ing and peering in the window waiting in the blind love,
their leaves too have hope and are upturned top flat
to the sky to receive--all creation open to receive--the
flat earth itself.
 
The music descends, as does the tall bending
stalk of the heavy blssom, because it has to, to stay
alive, to continue to the last drop of joy.
The world knows the love that's in its breast as

in the flower, the suffering lonely world.
The Father is merciful.
 
The light socket is crudely attached to the ceil-
ing, after the house was built, to receive a plug which
sticks in it alright, and serves my phonograph now...
 
The closet door is open for me, where I left it,
since I left it open, it has graciously stayed open.
The kitchen has no door, the hole there will
admit me should I wish to enter the kitchen.
I remember when I first got laid, H.P. gra-
ciously took my cherry, I sat on the docks of Prov-
incetown, age 23, joyful, elevated in hope with the
Father, the door to the womb wasopen to admit me
if I wished to enter.
 
There are unused electricity plugs all over my
house if I ever needed them.
The kitchen window is open, to admit air...
The telephone--sad to relate--sits on the
floor--I haven't had the money to get it connected--
 
I want people to bow when they see me and say
he is gifted with poetry, he has seen the presence of
the Creator
And the Creator gave me a shot of his presence
to gratify my wish, so as not to cheat me of my yearning
for him.

March
William Carlos Williams
I
 
Winter is long in this climate
and spring--a matter of a few days
only,--a flower or two picked
from mud or from among wet leaves
or at best against treacherous
bitterness of wind, and sky shining
teasingly, then closing in black
and sudden, with fierce jaws.

March,
you reminded me of
the pyramids, our pyramids--
stript of the polished stone
that used to guard them!
March,
you are like Fra Angelico
at Fiesole, painting on plaster!
 
March,
you are like a band of
young poets that have not learned
the blessedness of warmth
(or have forgotten it).
At any rate--
I am moved to write poetry
for the warmth there is in it
and for the loneliness--
a poem that shall have you
in it March.

See!
Ashur-ban-i-pal,
the archer king, on horse-back,
in blue and yellow enamel!
with drawn bow--facing lions
standing on their hind legs,
fangs bared! his shafts
bristling in their necks!
 
Sacred bulls--dragons
in embossed brickwork
marching--in four tiers--
along the sacred way to
Nebuchadnezzar's throne hall!
They shine in the sun,
they that have been marching--

marching under the dust of
ten thousand dirt years.
 
Now--
they are coming into bloom again!
See them!
marching still, bared by
the storms from my calender
--winds that blow back the sand!
winds that enfilade dirt!
winds that by strange craft
have whipt up a black army
that by pick and shovel
bare a procession to
the god, Marduk!
 
Natives cursing and digging
for pay unearth dragons with
upright tails and sacred bulls
alternately--
in four tiers--
lining the way to an old altar!
Natives digging at old walls--
digging me warmth--digging me sweet loneliness
high enamelled walls.

My second spring--
passed in a monastery
with plaster walls--in Fiesole
on the hill above 'Florence.
My second spring--painted
a virgin--in a blue aureole
sitting on a three-legged stool,
arms crossed--
she is intently serious,
and still
watching an angel
with colored wings
half kneeling before her--
and smiling--the angel's eyes
holding the eyes of Mary
as a snake's hold a bird's.
On the ground there are flowers,
trees are in leaf.
 
V
 
But! now for the battle!
Now for murder--now for the real thing!
My third springtime is approaching!

Winds!
lean, serious as a virgin,
seeking, seeking the flowers of March.
 
Seeking
flowers nowhere to be found,
they twine among the bare branches
in insatiable eagerness--
they whirl up the snow
seeking under it--
they--the winds--snakelike
roar among yellow reeds
seeking flowers--flowers.
 
I spring among them
seeking one flower
in which to warm myself!
 
I deride with all the ridicule
of misery--
my own starved misery.
 
Counter-cutting winds
strike against me
refreshing their fury!
 
Come, good, cold fellows!
Have we no flowers?
Defy then with even more
desperation than ever--being
lean and frozen!
 
But though you are lean and frozen--
think of the blue bulls of Babylon.
 
Fling yourselves upon
their empty roses--
cut savagely!
 
But--
think of the painted monastery
at Fiesole.

My business is words. Words are like labels,

OVER the carnage rose prophetic a voice,
Be not dishearten'd--Affection shall solve the problems of Freedom

Those who love each other shall become invincible--they shall yet
make Columbia victorious.
 
Sons of the Mother of All! you shall yet be victorious!
You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the
earth.
 
No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers;
If need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.
 
One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade;
From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another, an Oregonese, shall be
friends triune,
More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth. 
 
To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come;
Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.
 
It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly
affection;
The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly;
The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,
The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.
 
These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron;
I, extatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.

City whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and

City of wharves and stores! city of tall façades of marble and iron!
Proud and passionate city! mettlesome, mad, extravagant city!
Spring up, O city! not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself,
warlike! 
Fear not! submit to no models but your own, O city!
Behold me! incarnate me, as I have incarnated you!
I have rejected nothing you offer'd me--whom you adopted, I have
adopted;
Good or bad, I never question you--I love all--I do not condemn
anything;

In peace I chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine;
War, red war, is my song through your streets, O city!

Of blanched crystal, when, thrice one short night
Packed full with magic, and O blissful sight!
N'er May so warmly doth for April grieve.

And lo, to see it fading! Where, oh, where

The Earth Falls Down
Anne Sexton
If I could blame it all on the weather,
the snow like the cadaver's table,

the ground as hard as a frozen haddock,
the pond wearing its mustache of frost.
If I could blame conditions on that,
if I could blame the hearts of strangers
striding muffled down the street,
or blame the dogs, every color,
sniffing each other
and pissing on the doorstep...
If I could blame the bosses
and the presidents for
their unpardonable songs...
If I could blame it on all
the mothers and fathers of the world,
they of the lessons, the pellets of power,
they of the love surrounding you like batter...
Blame it on God perhaps?
He of the first opening
that pushed us all into our first mistakes?
No, I'll blame it on Man
For Man is God
and man is eating the earth up
like a candy bar
and not one of them can be left alone with the ocean
for it is known he will gulp it all down.
The stars (possibly) are safe.
At least for the moment.
The stars are pears

even for a wedding.

When I too long have looked upon your face,
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured
Save by the mists of brightness has its place,
And terrible beauty not to be endured,
I turn away reluctant from your light,
And stand irresolute, a mind undone,
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight
From having looked too long upon the sun.
Then is my daily life a narrow room
In which a little while, uncertainly,
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,
Among familiar things grown strange to me
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,
Till I become accustomed to the dark.

May-be the things I perceive--the animals, plants, men, hills,
shining and flowing waters,
The skies of day and night--colors, densities, forms--May-be these
are, (as doubtless they are,) only apparitions, and the real
something has yet to be known;
(How often they dart out of themselves, as if to confound me and mock
me!
How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them;)
May-be seeming to me what they are, (as doubtless they indeed but
seem,) as from my present point of view--And might prove, (as
of course they would,) naught of what they appear, or naught
any how, from entirely changed points of view;
--To me, these, and the like of these, are curiously answer'd by my
lovers, my dear friends; 
When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me
by the hand,
When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason
hold not, surround us and pervade us,
Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom--I am silent--I
require nothing further,
I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity
beyond the grave;
But I walk or sit indifferent--I am satisfied,
He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.

Women have loved before as I love now;
At least, in lively chronicles of the past -- 
Of Irish waters by a Cornish prow
Or Trojan waters by a Spartan mast
Much to their cost invaded -- here and there,
Hunting the amorous line, skimming the rest,
I find some woman bearing as I bear
Love like a burning city in the breast.
I think however that of all alive
I only in such utter, ancient way
Do suffer love; in me alone survive
The unregenerate passions of a day
When treacherous queens, with death upon the tread,
Heedless and willful, took their knights to bed.

And do you think that love itself,
Living in such an ugly house,
Can prosper long?

Our talk is all of heres and nows,
Our conduct likewise; in no act
Is any future, any past;
Under our sly, unspoken pact,
I KNOW with whom I saw you last,
But I say nothing; and you know
At six-fifteen to whom I go -- 
Can even love be treated so?
 
I KNOW, but I do not insist,
Having stealth and tact, thought not enough,
What hour your eye is on your wrist.
 
No wild appeal, no mild rebuff
Deflates the hour, leaves the wine flat -- 
 
Yet if YOU drop the picked-up book
To intercept my clockward look -- 
Tell me, can love go on like that?
 
Even the bored, insulted heart,
That signed so long and tight a lease,
Can BREAK it CONTRACT, slump in peace.

Rose Pogonias
Robert Frost
A saturated meadow,
Sun-shaped and jewel-small,
A circle scarcely wider
Than the trees around were tall;
Where winds were quite excluded,
And the air was stifling sweet
With the breath of many flowers, --
A temple of the heat.
There we bowed us in the burning,
As the sun's right worship is,
To pick where none could miss them
A thousand orchises;
For though the grass was scattered,
yet every second spear
Seemed tipped with wings of color,
That tinged the atmosphere.
We raised a simple prayer
Before we left the spot,
That in the general mowing
That place might be forgot;
Or if not all so favored,
Obtain such grace of hours,
that none should mow the grass there
While so confused with flowers.

Dialogue Between Ghost and Priest
Sylvia Plath
In the rectory garden on his evening walk
Paced brisk Father Shawn. A cold day, a sodden one it was
In black November. After a sliding rain
Dew stood in chill sweat on each stalk,
Each thorn; spiring from wet earth, a blue haze
Hung caught in dark-webbed branches like a fabulous heron.
 
Hauled sudden from solitude,
Hair prickling on his head,
Father Shawn perceived a ghost
Shaping itself from that mist.
 
'How now,' Father Shawn crisply addressed the ghost
Wavering there, gauze-edged, smelling of woodsmoke,
'What manner of business are you on?
From your blue pallor, I'd say you inhabited the frozen waste
Of hell, and not the fiery part. Yet to judge by that dazzled look,
That noble mien, perhaps you've late quitted heaven?'
 
In voice furred with frost,
Ghost said to priest:
'Neither of those countries do I frequent:
Earth is my haunt.'
 
'Come, come,' Father Shawn gave an impatient shrug,
'I don't ask you to spin some ridiculous fable
Of gilded harps or gnawing fire: simply tell
After your life's end, what just epilogue
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it such trouble
To satisfy the questions of a curious old fool?'
 
'In life, love gnawed my skin
To this white bone;
What love did then, love does now:
Gnaws me through.'
 
'What love,' asked Father Shawn, 'but too great love
Of flawed earth-flesh could cause this sorry pass?
Some damned condition you are in:
Thinking never to have left the world, you grieve
As though alive, shriveling in torment thus
To atone as shade for sin that lured blind man.'
 
'The day of doom
Is not yest come.
Until that time
A crock of dust is my dear hom.'
 
'Fond phantom,' cried shocked Father Shawn,
'Can there be such stubbornness--
A soul grown feverish, clutching its dead body-tree
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you gone

To judgment in a higher court of grace.
Repent, depart, before God's trump-crack splits the sky.'
 
From that pale mist
Ghost swore to priest:
'There sits no higher court
Than man's red heart.'

The Disputants

Upon the table in their bowl
in violent disarray
of yellow sprays, green spikes

and curled heads of blue

Coolly their colloquy continues

Come Up From The Fields, Father
Walt Whitman
COME up from the fields, father, here's a letter from our Pete;
And come to the front door, mother--here's a letter from thy dear
son.
 
Lo, 'tis autumn;
Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages, with leaves fluttering in the
moderate wind;
Where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd
vines;
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
Smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?)
 
Above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and
with wondrous clouds;
Below, too, all calm, all vital and beautiful--and the farm prospers
well. 
 
Down in the fields all prospers well;
But now from the fields come, father--come at the daughter's call;
And come to the entry, mother--to the front door come, right away.
 
Fast as she can she hurries--something ominous--her steps trembling;
She does not tarry to smoothe her hair, nor adjust her cap.
 
Open the envelope quickly;
O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd;
O a strange hand writes for our dear son--O stricken mother's soul!
All swims before her eyes--flashes with black--she catches the main
words only;
Sentences broken--gun-shot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,
taken to hospital, 
At present low, but will soon be better.
 
Ah, now, the single figure to me,
Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio, with all its cities and farms,
Sickly white in the face, and dull in the head, very faint,
By the jamb of a door leans.
 
Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through
her sobs;
The little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismay'd;)
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.
 
Alas, poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be
better, that brave and simple soul;)
While they stand at home at the door, he is dead already; 

The only son is dead.
 
But the mother needs to be better;
She, with thin form, presently drest in black;
By day her meals untouch'd--then at night fitfully sleeping, often
waking,
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,
O that she might withdraw unnoticed--silent from life, escape and
withdraw,
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.

from ""Asphodel, That Greeny Flower""
William Carlos Williams
Of asphodel, that greeny flower,
like a buttercup
upon its branching stem-
save that it's green and wooden-
I come, my sweet,
to sing to you.
We lived long together
a life filled,
if you will,
with flowers. So that
I was cheered
when I came first to know
that there were flowers also
in hell.
Today
I'm filled with the fading memory of those flowers
that we both loved,
even to this poor
colorless thing-
I saw it
when I was a child-
little prized among the living
but the dead see,
asking among themselves:
What do I remember
that was shaped
as this thing is shaped?
while our eyes fill
with tears.
Of love, abiding love
it will be telling
though too weak a wash of crimson
colors it
to make it wholly credible.
There is something
something urgent
I have to say to you
and you alone
but it must wait
while I drink in
the joy of your approach,
perhaps for the last time.
And so
with fear in my heart
I drag it out
and keep on talking
for I dare not stop.
Listen while I talk on
against time.
It will not be
for long.
I have forgot

and yet I see clearly enough
something
central to the sky
which ranges round it.
An odor
springs from it!
A sweetest odor!
Honeysuckle! And now
there comes the buzzing of a bee!
and a whole flood
of sister memories!
Only give me time,
time to recall them
before I shall speak out.
Give me time,
time.
When I was a boy
I kept a book
to which, from time
to time,
I added pressed flowers
until, after a time,
I had a good collection.
The asphodel,
forebodingly,
among them.
I bring you,
reawakened,
a memory of those flowers.
They were sweet
when I pressed them
and retained
something of their sweetness
a long time.
It is a curious odor,
a moral odor,
that brings me
near to you.
The color
was the first to go.
There had come to me
a challenge,
your dear self,
mortal as I was,
the lily's throat
to the hummingbird!
Endless wealth,
I thought,
held out its arms to me.
A thousand tropics
in an apple blossom.
The generous earth itself

gave us lief.
The whole world
became my garden!
But the sea
which no one tends
is also a garden
when the sun strikes it
and the waves
are wakened.
I have seen it
and so have you
when it puts all flowers
to shame.
Too, there are the starfish
stiffened by the sun
and other sea wrack
and weeds. We knew that
along with the rest of it
for we were born by the sea,
knew its rose hedges
to the very water's brink.
There the pink mallow grows
and in their season
strawberries
and there, later,
we went to gather
the wild plum.
I cannot say
that I have gone to hell
for your love
but often
found myself there
in your pursuit.
I do not like it
and wanted to be
in heaven. Hear me out.
Do not turn away.
I have learned much in my life
from books
and out of them
about love.
Death
is not the end of it.
There is a hierarchy
which can be attained,
I think,
in its service.
Its guerdon
is a fairy flower;
a cat of twenty lives.
If no one came to try it
the world

would be the loser.
It has been
for you and me
as one who watches a storm
come in over the water.
We have stood
from year to year
before the spectacle of our lives
with joined hands.
The storm unfolds.
Lightning
plays about the edges of the clouds.
The sky to the north
is placid,
blue in the afterglow
as the storm piles up.
It is a flower
that will soon reach
the apex of its bloom.
We danced,
in our minds,
and read a book together.
You remember?
It was a serious book.
And so books
entered our lives.
The sea! The sea!
Always
when I think of the sea
there comes to mind
the Iliad
and Helen's public fault
that bred it.
Were it not for that
there would have been
no poem but the world
if we had remembered,
those crimson petals
spilled among the stones,
would have called it simply
murder.
The sexual orchid that bloomed then
sending so many
disinterested
men to their graves
has left its memory
to a race of fools
or heroes
if silence is a virtue.
The sea alone
with its multiplicity
holds any hope.

The storm
has proven abortive
but we remain
after the thoughts it roused
to
re-cement our lives.
It is the mind
the mind
that must be cured
short of death's
intervention,
and the will becomes again
a garden. The poem
is complex and the place made
in our lives
for the poem.
Silence can be complex too,
but you do not get far
with silence.
Begin again.
It is like Homer's
catalogue of ships:
it fills up the time.
I speak in figures,
well enough, the dresses
you wear are figures also,
we could not meet
otherwise. When I speak
of flowers
it is to recall
that at one time
we were young.
All women are not Helen,
I know that,
but have Helen in their hearts.
My sweet,
you have it also, therefore
I love you
and could not love you otherwise.
Imagine you saw
a field made up of women
all silver-white.
What should you do
but love them?
The storm bursts
or fades! it is not
the end of the world.
Love is something else,
or so I thought it,
a garden which expands,
though I knew you as a woman
and never thought otherwise,

until the whole sea
has been taken up
and all its gardens.
It was the love of love,
the love that swallows up all else,
a grateful love,
a love of nature, of people,
of animals,
a love engendering
gentleness and goodness
that moved me
and that I saw in you.
I should have known,
though I did not,
that the lily-of-the-valley
is a flower makes many ill
who whiff it.
We had our children,
rivals in the general onslaught.
I put them aside
though I cared for them.
as well as any man
could care for his children
according to my lights.
You understand
I had to meet you
after the event
and have still to meet you.
Love
to which you too shall bow
along with me-
a flower
a weakest flower
shall be our trust
and not because
we are too feeble
to do otherwise
but because
at the height of my power
I risked what I had to do,
therefore to prove
that we love each other
while my very bones sweated
that I could not cry to you
in the act.
Of asphodel, that greeny flower,
I come, my sweet,
to sing to you!
My heart rouses
thinking to bring you news
of something
that concerns you

and concerns many men. Look at
what passes for the new.
You will not find it there but in
despised poems.
It is difficult
to get the news from poems
yet men die miserably every day
for lack
of what is found there.
Hear me out
for I too am concerned
and every man
who wants to die at peace in his bed
besides.

If I Should Learn, In Some Quite Casual Way

IF I should learn, in some quite casual way,
That you were gone, not to return again -- 
Read from the back-page of a paper, say,
Held by a neighbor in a subway train,
How at the corner of this avenue
And such a street (so are the papers filled)
A hurrying man -- who happened to be you -- 
At noon to-day had happened to be killed,
I should not cry aloud -- I could not cry
Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place --

With a more careful interest on my face,
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care
Where to store furs and how to treat the hair.

Stillborn
Sylvia Plath
These poems do not live: it's a sad diagnosis.
They grew their toes and fingers well enough,
Their little foreheads bulged with concentration.
If they missed out on walking about like people
It wasn't for any lack of mother-love.
 
O I cannot explain what happened to them!
They are proper in shape and number and every part.
They sit so nicely in the pickling fluid!
They smile and smile and smile at me.
And still the lungs won't fill and the heart won't start.
 
They are not pigs, they are not even fish,
Though they have a piggy and a fishy air --
It would be better if they were alive, and that's what they were.
But they are dead, and their mother near dead with distraction,
And they stupidly stare and do not speak of her.

On A Tree Fallen Across The Road
Robert Frost
(To hear us talk)
The tree the tempest with a crash of wood
Throws down in front of us is not bar
Our passage to our journey's end for good,
But just to ask us who we think we are
Insisting always on our own way so.
She likes to halt us in our runner tracks,
And make us get down in a foot of snow
Debating what to do without an ax.
And yet she knows obstruction is in vain:
We will not be put off the final goal
We have it hidden in us to attain,
Not though we have to seize earth by the pole
And, tired of aimless circling in one place,
Steer straight off after something into space.

A Sight In Camp
Walt Whitman
A SIGHT in camp in the day-break grey and dim,
As from my tent I emerge so early, sleepless,
As slow I walk in the cool fresh air, the path near by the hospital
tent,
Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there, untended
lying,
Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,
Grey and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.
 
Curious, I halt, and silent stand;
Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest, the first,
just lift the blanket:
Who are you, elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-grey'd hair,
and flesh all sunken about the eyes?
Who are you, my dear comrade? 
 
Then to the second I step--And who are you, my child and darling?
Who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet blooming?
 
Then to the third--a face nor child, nor old, very calm, as of
beautiful yellow-white ivory;
Young man, I think I know you--I think this face of yours is the face
of the Christ himself;
Dead and divine, and brother of all, and here again he lies.

The Evil Seekers
Anne Sexton
We are born with luck
which is to say with gold in our mouth.
As new and smooth as a grape,
as pure as a pond in Alaska,
as good as the stem of a green bean--
we are born and that ought to be enough,
we ought to be able to carry on from that
but one must learn about evil,
learn what is subhuman,
learn how the blood pops out like a scream,
one must see the night
before one can realize the day,
one must listen hard to the animal within,
one must walk like a sleepwalker
on the edge of a roof,
one must throw some part of her body
into the devil's mouth.
Odd stuff, you'd say.
But I'd say
you must die a little,
have a book of matches go off in your hand,
see your best friend copying your exam,
visit an Indian reservation and see
their plastic feathers,
the dead dream.
One must be a prisoner just once to hear
the lock twist into his gut.
After all that
one is free to grasp at the trees, the stones,
the sky, the birds that make sense out of air.
But even in a telephone booth
evil can seep out of the receiver
and we must cover it with a mattress,
and then tear it from its roots
and bury it,
bury it.

The Frog Prince
Anne Sexton
Frau Doktor,
Mama Brundig,
take out your contacts,
remove your wig.
I write for you.
I entertain.
But frogs come out
of the sky like rain.
 
Frogs arrive
With an ugly fury.
You are my judge.
You are my jury.
 
My guilts are what
we catalogue.
I'll take a knife
and chop up frog.
 
Frog has not nerves.
Frog is as old as a cockroach.
Frog is my father's genitals.
Frog is a malformed doorknob.
Frog is a soft bag of green.
 
The moon will not have him.
The sun wants to shut off
like a light bulb.
At the sight of him
the stone washes itself in a tub.
The crow thinks he's an apple
and drops a worm in.
At the feel of frog
the touch-me-nots explode
like electric slugs.
Slime will have him.
Slime has made him a house.
 
Mr. Poison
is at my bed.
He wants my sausage.
He wants my bread.
 
Mama Brundig,
he wants my beer.
He wants my Christ
for a souvenir.
 
Frog has boil disease
and a bellyful of parasites.
He says: Kiss me. Kiss me.
And the ground soils itself.

Why
should a certain
quite adorable princess
be walking in her garden
at such a time
and toss her golden ball
up like a bubble
and drop it into the well?
It was ordained.
Just as the fates deal out
the plague with a tarot card.
Just as the Supreme Being drills
holes in our skulls to let
the Boston Symphony through.
 
But I digress.
A loss has taken place.
The ball has sunk like a cast-iron pot
into the bottom of the well.
 
Lost, she said,
my moon, my butter calf,
my yellow moth, my Hindu hare.
Obviously it was more than a ball.
Balls such as these are not
for sale in Au Bon Marché.
I took the moon, she said,
between my teeth
and now it is gone
and I am lost forever.
A thief had robbed by day.
 
Suddenly the well grew
thick and boiling
and a frog appeared.
His eyes bulged like two peas
and his body was trussed into place.
Do not be afraid, Princess,
he said, I am not a vagabond,
a cattle farmer, a shepherd,
a doorkeeper, a postman
or a laborer.
I come to you as a tradesman.
I have something to sell.
Your ball, he said,
for just three things.
Let me eat from your plate.
Let me drink from your cup.
Let me sleep in your bed.
She thought, Old Waddler,
those three you will never do,

but she made the promises
with hopes for her ball once more.
He brought it up in his mouth
like a tricky old dog
and she ran back to the castle
leaving the frog quite alone.
 
That evening at dinner time
a knock was heard on the castle door
and a voice demanded:
King's youngest daughter,
let me in. You promised;
now open to me.
I have left the skunk cabbage
and the eels to live with you.
The kind then heard her promise
and forced her to comply.
 
The frog first sat on her lap.
He was as awful as an undertaker.
Next he was at her plate
looking over her bacon
and calves' liver.
We will eat in tandem,
he said gleefully.
Her fork trembled
as if a small machine
had entered her.
He sat upon the liver
and partook like a gourmet.
The princess choked
as if she were eating a puppy.
From her cup he drank.
It wasn't exactly hygienic.
From her cup she drank
as if it were Socrates' hemlock.
 
Next came the bed.
The silky royal bed.
Ah! The penultimate hour!
There was the pillow
with the princess breathing
and there was the sinuous frog
riding up and down beside her.
I have been lost in a river
of shut doors, he said,
and I have made my way over
the wet stones to live with you.
She woke up aghast.
I suffer for birds and fireflies
but not frogs, she said,
and threw him across the room.

Kaboom!
 
Like a genie coming out of a samovar,
a handsome prince arose in the
corner of her bedroom.
He had kind eyes and hands
and was a friend of sorrow.
Thus they were married.
After all he had compromised her.
 
He hired a night watchman
so that no one could enter the chamber

Each Second is the last
Emily Dickinson

 
Each Second is the last
Perhaps, recalls the Man
Just measuring unconsciousness
The Sea and Spar between.
 
To fail within a Chance--
How terribler a thing
Than perish from the Chance's list
Before the Perishing!

The Penitent
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I had a little Sorrow,
Born of a little Sin,
I found a room all damp with gloom
And shut us all within;
And, ""Little Sorrow, weep,"" said I,
""And, Little Sin, pray God to die,
And I upon the floor will lie
And think how bad I've been!""
 
Alas for pious planning -- 
It mattered not a whit!
As far as gloom went in that room,
The lamp might have been lit!
My little Sorrow would not weep,
My little Sin would go to sleep -- 
To save my soul I could not keep
My graceless mind on it!
 
So I got up in anger,
And took a book I had,
And put a ribbon on my hair
To please a passing lad,
And, ""One thing there's no getting by -- 
I've been a wicked girl,"" said I:
""But if I can't be sorry, why,
I might as well be glad!""

Rhapsody on a Windy Night
Thomas Stearns Eliot
Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Disolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.
 
Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said,
'Regard that woman
Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.'
 
The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.
 
Half-past two,
The street-lamp said,
'Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.'
So the hand of the child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along
the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
 
Half-past three,

The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.
 
The lamp hummed:
'Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smooths the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geriniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets
And female smells in shuttered rooms
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.'
 
The lamp said,
'Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.'
 
The last twist of the knife.

Faith--is the Pierless Bridge

Unto the Scene that We do not--
Too slender for the eye
 
It bears the Soul as bold
As it were rocked in Steel
With Arms of Steel at either side--

The Bridge would cease to be
To Our far, vacillating Feet

The Little Ghost
Edna St. Vincent Millay
I knew her for a little ghost
That in my garden walked;
The wall is high -- higher than most -- 
And the green gate was locked.
 
And yet I did not think of that
Till after she was gone -- 
I knew her by the broad white hat,
All ruffled, she had on.
 
By the dear ruffles round her feet,
By her small hands that hung
In their lace mitts, austere and sweet,
Her gown's white folds among.
 
I watched to see if she would stay,
What she would do -- and oh!
She looked as if she liked the way
I let my garden grow!
 
She bent above my favourite mint
With conscious garden grace,
She smiled and smiled -- there was no hint
Of sadness in her face.
 
She held her gown on either side
To let her slippers show,
And up the walk she went with pride,
The way great ladies go.
 
And where the wall is built in new
And is of ivy bare
She paused -- then opened and passed through
A gate that once was there.

Ginza Samba
Robert Pinsky
A monosyllabic European called Sax
Invents a horn, walla whirledy wah, a kind of twisted
Brazen clarinet, but with its column of vibrating
Air shaped not in a cylinder but in a cone
Widening ever outward and bawaah spouting
Infinitely upward through an upturned
Swollen golden bell rimmed
Like a gloxinia flowering
In Sax's Belgian imagination
 
And in the unfathomable matrix
Of mothers and fathers as a genius graven
Humming into the cells of the body
Or cupped in the resonating grail
Of memory changed and exchanged
As in the trading of brasses,
Pearls and ivory, calicos and slaves,
Laborers and girls, two
 
Cousins in a royal family
Of Niger known as the Birds or Hawks.
In Christendom one cousin's child
Becomes a ""favorite negro"" ennobled
By decree of the Czar and founds
A great family, a line of generals,
Dandies and courtiers including the poet
Pushkin, killed in a duel concerning
His wife's honor, while the other cousin sails
 
In the belly of a slaveship to the port
Of Baltimore where she is raped
And dies in childbirth, but the infant
Will marry a Seminole and in the next
Chorus of time their child fathers
A great Hawk or Bird, with many followers
Among them this great-grandchild of the Jewish
Manager of a Pushkin estate, blowing
 
His American breath out into the wiggly
Tune uncurling its triplets and sixteenths--the Ginza
Samba of breath and brass, the reed
Vibrating as a valve, the aether, the unimaginable
Wires and circuits of an ingenious box
Here in my room in this house built
A hundred years ago while I was elsewhere:
 
It is like falling in love, the atavistic
Imperative of some one
Voice or face--the skill, the copper filament,
The golden bellful of notes twirling through
Their invisible element from
Rio to Tokyo and back again gathering

Speed in the variations as they tunnel
The twin haunted labyrinths of stirrup
And anvil echoing here in the hearkening
Instrument of my skull.

The Ambition Bird
Anne Sexton
So it has come to this
insomnia at 3:15 A.M.,
the clock tolling its engine
 
like a frog following
a sundial yet having an electric
seizure at the quarter hour.
 
The business of words keeps me awake.
I am drinking cocoa,
that warm brown mama.
 
I would like a simple life
yet all night I am laying
poems away in a long box.
 
It is my immortality box,
my lay-away plan,
my coffin.
 
All night dark wings
flopping in my heart.
Each an ambition bird.
 
The bird wants to be dropped
from a high place like Tallahatchie Bridge.
 
He wants to light a kitchen match
and immolate himself.
 
He wants to fly into the hand of Michelangelo
anc dome out painted on a ceiling.
 
He wants to pierce the hornet's nest
and come out with a long godhead.
 
He wants to take bread and wine
and bring forth a man happily floating in the Caribbean.
 
He wants to be pressed out like a key
so he can unlock the Magi.
 
He wants to take leave among strangers
passing out bits of his heart like hors d'oeuvres.
 
He wants to die changing his clothes
and bolt for the sun like a diamond.
 
He wants, I want.
Dear God, wouldn't it be
good enough to just drink cocoa?

I must get a new bird
and a new immortality box.
There is folly enough inside this one.

Before the skaters go,
Or any check at nightfall

Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder upon wonder
Will arrive to me!
 
What we touch the hems of

The Untrustworthy Speaker
Louise Gluck
Don't listen to me; my heart's been broken.
I don't see anything objectively.
 
I know myself; I've learned to hear like a psychiatrist.
When I speak passionately,
That's when I'm least to be trusted.
 
It's very sad, really: all my life I've been praised
For my intelligence, my powers of language, of insight-
In the end they're wasted-
 
I never see myself.
Standing on the front steps. Holding my sisters hand.
That's why I can't account
For the bruises on her arm where the sleeve ends . . .
 
In my own mind, I'm invisible: that's why I'm dangerous.
People like me, who seem selfless.
We're the cripples, the liars:
We're the ones who should be factored out
In the interest of truth.
 
When I'm quiet, that's when the truth emerges.
A clear sky, the clouds like white fibers.
Underneath, a little gray house. The azaleas
Red and bright pink.
 
If you want the truth, you have to close yourself
To the older sister, block her out:
When I living thing is hurt like that
In its deepest workings,
All function is altered.
 
That's why I'm not to be trusted.
Because a wound to the heart
Is also a wound to the mind.

Color of lemon, mango, peach,
These storybook villas
Still dream behind
Shutters, thier balconies
Fine as hand-
Made lace, or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch.
 
Tilting with the winds,
On arrowy stems,
Pineapple-barked,
A green crescent of palms
Sends up its forked
Firework of fronds.
 
A quartz-clear dawn
Inch by bright inch
Gilds all our Avenue,
And out of the blue drench
Of Angels' Bay
Rises the round red watermelon sun.

As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods
Walt Whitman
As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,
To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)
I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;
Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all I could understand,)
The halt of a midday hour, when up! no time to lose--yet this sign left,
On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,
Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.
 
Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,
Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,
Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in the crowded
street,
Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, come the inscription rude in
Virginia's
woods.
Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.

Utter symbol of all old sweet druidings,
Mem'ry of witched wold and green,

Neath the shadows of thy weaving
Dreams that need no undeceiving,
Loves that longer hold me not,
Dreams I dream not any more,
Fragrance of old sweet forgotten places,
Smiles of dream-lit, flit-by faces
All as perfume Arab-sweet
Deck the high road to thy feet
 
As were Godiva's coming fated
And all the April's blush belated
Were lain before her, carpeting
The stones of Coventry with spring,
So thou my mist-enwreathéd queen,

Riding engloried in they hair
Mak'st by-road of our dreams

give me your mirror.
Boils fester in my soul,

How thick about us root, how rankly grow
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend,
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow
Our steady senses; how such matters go
We are aware, and how such matters end.
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here;
With lovers such as we forevermore

Receives the Table's ruin through her door,

Lets fall the colored book upon the floor.

as we sat on the wagon seat,
""Be sure to remember to always
speak to everyone you meet.""
 
We met a stranger on foot.
My grandfather's whip tapped his hat.
""Good day, sir. Good day. A fine day.""
And I said it and bowed where I sat.
 
Then we overtook a boy we knew
with his big pet crow on his shoulder.
""Always offer everyone a ride;
don't forget that when you get older,""
 
my grandfather said. So Willy
climbed up with us, but the crow
gave a ""Caw!"" and flew off. I was worried.
How would he know where to go?
 
But he flew a little way at a time
from fence post to fence post, ahead;
and when Willy whistled he answered.
""A fine bird,"" my grandfather said,
 
""and he's well brought up. See, he answers
nicely when he's spoken to.
Man or beast, that's good manners.
Be sure that you both always do.""
 
When automobiles went by,
the dust hid the people's faces,
but we shouted ""Good day! Good day!
Fine day!"" at the top of our voices.

he said that the mare was tired,
so we all got down and walked,

By her contriving, if accounts be true:
Their deference now above the board, I guess,
Dishcharges what beneath the board is due.
As for myself, I'd liefer lack her aid

The Star Splitter
Robert Frost
`You know Orion always comes up sideways.
Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,
And rising on his hands, he looks in on me
Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something
I should have done by daylight, and indeed,
After the ground is frozen, I should have done
Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful
Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
To make fun of my way of doing things,
Or else fun of Orion's having caught me.
Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights
These forces are obliged to pay respect to?'
So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk
Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,
Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming
He burned his house down for the fire insurance
And spent the proceeds on a telescope
To satisfy a lifelong curiosity
About our place among the infinities.
`What do you want with one of those blame things?'
I asked him well beforehand. `Don't you get one!'
`Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything
More blameless in the sense of being less
A weapon in our human fight,' he said.
`I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.'
There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move,
Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years
Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,
He burned his house down for the fire insurance
And bought the telescope with what it came to.
He had been heard to say by several:
`The best thing that we're put here for's to see;
The strongest thing that's given us to see with's
A telescope. Someone in every town
Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.
In Littleton it might as well be me.'
After such loose talk it was no surprise
When he did what he did and burned his house down.
Mean laughter went about the town that day
To let him know we weren't the least imposed on,
And he could wait---we'd see to him tomorrow.
But the first thing next morning we reflected
If one by one we counted people out
For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long
To get so we had no one left to live with.
For to be social is to be forgiving.
Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,
We don't cut off from coming to church suppers,
But what we miss we go to him and ask for.
He promptly gives it back, that is if still
Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.
It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad
About his telescope. Beyond the age
Of being given one for Christmas gift,
He had to take the best way he knew how
To find himself in one. Well, all we said was
He took a strange thing to be roguish over.
Some sympathy was wasted on the house,
A good old-timer dating back along;
But a house isn't sentient; the house
Didn't feel anything. And if it did,
Why not regard it as a sacrifice,
And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,
Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?
Out of a house and so out of a farm
At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn
To earn a living on the Concord railroad,
As under-ticket-agent at a station
Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets,
Was setting out, up track and down, not plants
As on a farm, but planets, evening stars
That varied in their hue from red to green.
He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.
His new job gave him leisure for stargazing.
Often he bid me come and have a look
Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,
At a star quaking in the other end.
I recollect a night of broken clouds
And underfoot snow melted down to ice,
And melting further in the wind to mud.
Bradford and I had out the telescope.
We spread our two legs as we spread its three,
Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,
And standing at our leisure till the day broke,
Said some of the best things we ever said.
That telescope was christened the Star-Splitter,
Because it didn't do a thing but split
A star in two or three, the way you split
A globule of quicksilver in your hand
With one stroke of your finger in the middle.
It's a star-splitter if there ever was one,
And ought to do some good if splitting stars
'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.
We've looked and looked, but after all where are we?
Do we know any better where we are,
And how it stands between the night tonight
And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
How different from the way it ever stood?

The Map
Elizabeth Bishop
Land lies in water; it is shadowed green.
Shadows, or are they shallows, at its edges
showing the line of long sea-weeded ledges
where weeds hang to the simple blue from green.
Or does the land lean down to lift the sea from under,
drawing it unperturbed around itself?
Along the fine tan sandy shelf
is the land tugging at the sea from under?
 
The shadow of Newfoundland lies flat and still.
Labrador's yellow, where the moony Eskimo
has oiled it. We can stroke these lovely bays,
under a glass as if they were expected to blossom,
or as if to provide a clean cage for invisible fish.
The names of seashore towns run out to sea,
the names of cities cross the neighboring mountains
-the printer here experiencing the same excitement
as when emotion too far exceeds its cause.
These peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger
like women feeling for the smoothness of yard-goods.
 
Mapped waters are more quiet than the land is,
lending the land their waves' own conformation:
and Norway's hare runs south in agitation,
profiles investigate the sea, where land is.
Are they assigned, or can the countries pick their colors?

Bound—a trouble
Emily Dickinson

 
Bound—a trouble—
And lives can bear it!
Limit—how deep a bleeding go!
So—many—drops—of vital scarlet—
Deal with the soul
As with Algebra!
 
Tell it the Ages—to a cypher—
And it will ache—contented—on—
Sing—at its pain—as any Workman—
Notching the fall of the Even Sun!

Further Instructions
Ezra Pound
Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions.
Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry about the future.
You are very idle, my songs,
I fear you will come to a bad end.
You stand about the streets, You loiter at the corners and bus-stops,
You do next to nothing at all.
 
You do not even express our inner nobilitys,
You will come to a very bad end.
 
And I? I have gone half-cracked.
I have talked to you so much that I almost see you about me,
Insolent little beasts! Shameless! Devoid of clothing!
 
But you, newest song of the lot,
You are not old enough to have done much mischief.
I will get you a green coat out of China
With dragons worked upon it.
I will get you the scarlet silk trousers
From the statue of the infant Christ at Santa Maria Novella;
Lest they say we are lacking in taste,
Or that there is no caste in this family.

Passage To India
Walt Whitman
SINGING my days,
Singing the great achievements of the present,
Singing the strong, light works of engineers,
Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)
In the Old World, the east, the Suez canal,
The New by its mighty railroad spann'd,
The seas inlaid with eloquent, gentle wires,
I sound, to commence, the cry, with thee, O soul,
The Past! the Past! the Past!
 
The Past! the dark, unfathom'd retrospect! 
The teeming gulf! the sleepers and the shadows!
The past! the infinite greatness of the past!
For what is the present, after all, but a growth out of the past?
(As a projectile, form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, still
keeps on,
So the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past.)
 
Passage, O soul, to India!
Eclaircise the myths Asiatic--the primitive fables.
 
Not you alone, proud truths of the world!
Nor you alone, ye facts of modern science!
But myths and fables of eld--Asia's, Africa's fables! 
The far-darting beams of the spirit!--the unloos'd dreams!
The deep diving bibles and legends;
The daring plots of the poets--the elder religions;
--O you temples fairer than lilies, pour'd over by the rising sun!
O you fables, spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known,
mounting to heaven!
You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses, burnish'd
with gold!
Towers of fables immortal, fashion'd from mortal dreams!
You too I welcome, and fully, the same as the rest;
You too with joy I sing.
 
Passage to India! 
Lo, soul! seest thou not God's purpose from the first?
The earth to be spann'd, connected by net-work,
The people to become brothers and sisters,
The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,
The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,
The lands to be welded together.
 
(A worship new, I sing;
You captains, voyagers, explorers, yours!
You engineers! you architects, machinists, your!
You, not for trade or transportation only, 
But in God's name, and for thy sake, O soul.)

Passage to India!
Lo, soul, for thee, of tableaus twain,
I see, in one, the Suez canal initiated, open'd,
I see the procession of steamships, the Empress Eugenie's leading the
van;
I mark, from on deck, the strange landscape, the pure sky, the level
sand in the distance;
I pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,
The gigantic dredging machines.
 
In one, again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)
I see over my own continent the Pacific Railroad, surmounting every
barrier; 
I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte, carrying
freight and passengers;
I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam-
whistle,
I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the
world;
I cross the Laramie plains--I note the rocks in grotesque shapes--the
buttes;
I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions--the barren, colorless,
sage-deserts;
I see in glimpses afar, or towering immediately above me, the great
mountains--I see the Wind River and the Wahsatch mountains;
I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle's Nest--I pass the
Promontory--I ascend the Nevadas;
I scan the noble Elk mountain, and wind around its base;
I see the Humboldt range--I thread the valley and cross the river,
I see the clear waters of Lake Tahoe--I see forests of majestic
pines, 
Or, crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold
enchanting mirages of waters and meadows;
Marking through these, and after all, in duplicate slender lines,
Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,
Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,
The road between Europe and Asia.
 
(Ah Genoese, thy dream! thy dream!
Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,
The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream!)
 
Passage to India!
Struggles of many a captain--tales of many a sailor dead! 
Over my mood, stealing and spreading they come,
Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky.
 
Along all history, down the slopes,
As a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the surface

rising,
A ceaseless thought, a varied train--Lo, soul! to thee, thy sight,
they rise,
The plans, the voyages again, the expeditions:
Again Vasco de Gama sails forth;
Again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,
Lands found, and nations born--thou born, America, (a hemisphere
unborn,)
For purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd, 
Thou, rondure of the world, at last accomplish'd.
 
O, vast Rondure, swimming in space!
Cover'd all over with visible power and beauty!
Alternate light and day, and the teeming, spiritual darkness;
Unspeakable, high processions of sun and moon, and countless stars,
above;
Below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, trees;
With inscrutable purpose--some hidden, prophetic intention;
Now, first, it seems, my thought begins to span thee.
 
Down from the gardens of Asia, descending, radiating,
Adam and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them, 
Wandering, yearning, curious--with restless explorations,
With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish--with never-happy
hearts,
With that sad, incessant refrain, Wherefore, unsatisfied Soul? and
Whither, O mocking Life?
 
Ah, who shall soothe these feverish children?
Who justify these restless explorations?
Who speak the secret of impassive Earth?
Who bind it to us? What is this separate Nature, so unnatural?
What is this Earth, to our affections? (unloving earth, without a
throb to answer ours;
Cold earth, the place of graves.)
 
Yet, soul, be sure the first intent remains--and shall be carried
out; 
(Perhaps even now the time has arrived.)
 
After the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,)
After the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd their work,
After the noble inventors--after the scientists, the chemist, the
geologist, ethnologist,
Finally shall come the Poet, worthy that name;
The true Son of God shall come, singing his songs.
 
Then, not your deeds only, O voyagers, O scientists and inventors,
shall be justified,
All these hearts, as of fretted children, shall be sooth'd,
All affection shall be fully responded to--the secret shall be told;

All these separations and gaps shall be taken up, and hook'd and
link'd together; 
The whole Earth--this cold, impassive, voiceless Earth, shall be
completely justified;
Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by the
the Son of God, the poet,
(He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains,
He shall double the Cape of Good Hope to some purpose;)
Nature and Man shall be disjoin'd and diffused no more,
The true Son of God shall absolutely fuse them.
 
Year at whose open'd, wide-flung door I sing!
Year of the purpose accomplish'd!
Year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans!
(No mere Doge of Venice now, wedding the Adriatic;) 
I see, O year, in you, the vast terraqueous globe, given, and giving
all,
Europe to Asia, Africa join'd, and they to the New World;
The lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival
garland,
As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand.
 
Passage to India!
Cooling airs from Caucasus far, soothing cradle of man,
The river Euphrates flowing, the past lit up again.
 
Lo, soul, the retrospect, brought forward;
The old, most populous, wealthiest of Earth's lands,
The streams of the Indus and the Ganges, and their many
affluents; 
(I, my shores of America walking to-day, behold, resuming all,)
The tale of Alexander, on his warlike marches, suddenly dying,
On one side China, and on the other side Persia and Arabia,
To the south the great seas, and the Bay of Bengal;
The flowing literatures, tremendous epics, religions, castes,
Old occult Brahma, interminably far back--the tender and junior
Buddha,
Central and southern empires, and all their belongings, possessors,
The wars of Tamerlane, the reign of Aurungzebe,
The traders, rulers, explorers, Moslems, Venetians, Byzantium, the
Arabs, Portuguese,
The first travelers, famous yet, Marco Polo, Batouta the Moor, 
Doubts to be solv'd, the map incognita, blanks to be fill'd,
The foot of man unstay'd, the hands never at rest,
Thyself, O soul, that will not brook a challenge.
 
The medieval navigators rise before me,
The world of 1492, with its awaken'd enterprise;
Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in

spring,
The sunset splendor of chivalry declining.
 
And who art thou, sad shade?
Gigantic, visionary, thyself a visionary,
With majestic limbs, and pious, beaming eyes, 
Spreading around, with every look of thine, a golden world,
Enhuing it with gorgeous hues.
 
As the chief histrion,
Down to the footlights walks, in some great scena,
Dominating the rest, I see the Admiral himself,
(History's type of courage, action, faith;)
Behold him sail from Palos, leading his little fleet;
His voyage behold--his return--his great fame,
His misfortunes, calumniators--behold him a prisoner, chain'd,
Behold his dejection, poverty, death. 
 
(Curious, in time, I stand, noting the efforts of heroes;
Is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death?
Lies the seed unreck'd for centuries in the ground? Lo! to God's due
occasion,
Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,
And fills the earth with use and beauty.)
 
Passage indeed, O soul, to primal thought!
Not lands and seas alone--thy own clear freshness,
The young maturity of brood and bloom;
To realms of budding bibles.
 
O soul, repressless, I with thee, and thou with me, 
Thy circumnavigation of the world begin;
Of man, the voyage of his mind's return,
To reason's early paradise,
Back, back to wisdom's birth, to innocent intuitions,
Again with fair Creation.
 
O we can wait no longer!
We too take ship, O soul!
Joyous, we too launch out on trackless seas!
Fearless, for unknown shores, on waves of extasy to sail,
Amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, I thee to me, O
soul,) 
Caroling free--singing our song of God,
Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration.
 
With laugh, and many a kiss,
(Let others deprecate--let others weep for sin, remorse,
humiliation;)
O soul, thou pleasest me--I thee.

Ah, more than any priest, O soul, we too believe in God;
But with the mystery of God we dare not dally.
 
O soul, thou pleasest me--I thee;
Sailing these seas, or on the hills, or waking in the night,
Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time, and Space, and Death, like waters
flowing, 
Bear me, indeed, as through the regions infinite,
Whose air I breathe, whose ripples hear--lave me all over;
Bathe me, O God, in thee--mounting to thee,
I and my soul to range in range of thee.
 
O Thou transcendant!
Nameless--the fibre and the breath!
Light of the light--shedding forth universes--thou centre of them!
Thou mightier centre of the true, the good, the loving!
Thou moral, spiritual fountain! affection's source! thou reservoir!
(O pensive soul of me! O thirst unsatisfied! waitest not there? 
Waitest not haply for us, somewhere there, the Comrade perfect?)
Thou pulse! thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,
That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,
Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space!
 
How should I think--how breathe a single breath--how speak--if, out
of myself,
I could not launch, to those, superior universes?
 
Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God,
At Nature and its wonders, Time and Space and Death,
But that I, turning, call to thee, O soul, thou actual Me,
And lo! thou gently masterest the orbs, 
Thou matest Time, smilest content at Death,
And fillest, swellest full, the vastnesses of Space.
 
Greater than stars or suns,
Bounding, O soul, thou journeyest forth;
--What love, than thine and ours could wider amplify?
What aspirations, wishes, outvie thine and ours, O soul?
What dreams of the ideal? what plans of purity, perfection, strength?
What cheerful willingness, for others' sake, to give up all?
For others' sake to suffer all?
 
Reckoning ahead, O soul, when thou, the time achiev'd, 
(The seas all cross'd, weather'd the capes, the voyage done,)
Surrounded, copest, frontest God, yieldest, the aim attain'd,
As, fill'd with friendship, love complete, the Elder Brother found,
The Younger melts in fondness in his arms.
 
Passage to more than India!
Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?

O Soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like these?
Disportest thou on waters such as these?
Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?
Then have thy bent unleash'd. 
 
Passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas!
Passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!
You, strew'd with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never
reach'd you.
 
Passage to more than India!
O secret of the earth and sky!
Of you, O waters of the sea! O winding creeks and rivers!
Of you, O woods and fields! Of you, strong mountains of my land!
Of you, O prairies! Of you, gray rocks!
O morning red! O clouds! O rain and snows!
O day and night, passage to you! 
 
O sun and moon, and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter!
Passage to you!
 
Passage--immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!
Away, O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!
Cut the hawsers--haul out--shake out every sail!
Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough?
Have we not grovell'd here long enough, eating and drinking like mere
brutes?
Have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books long enough?
 
Sail forth! steer for the deep waters only!
Reckless, O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me; 
For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,
And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.
 
O my brave soul!
O farther, farther sail!
O daring joy, but safe! Are they not all the seas of God?
O farther, farther, farther sail!

Hey Father Death, I'm flying home
Hey poor man, you're all alone
Hey old daddy, I know where I'm going
 
Father Death, Don't cry any more
Mama's there, underneath the floor
Brother Death, please mind the store
 
Old Aunty Death Don't hide your bones
Old Uncle Death I hear your groans
O Sister Death how sweet your moans
 
O Children Deaths go breathe your breaths
Sobbing breasts'll ease your Deaths
Pain is gone, tears take the rest
 
Genius Death your art is done
Lover Death your body's gone
Father Death I'm coming home
 
Guru Death your words are true
Teacher Death I do thank you
For inspiring me to sing this Blues
 
Buddha Death, I wake with you
Dharma Death, your mind is new
Sangha Death, we'll work it through
 
Suffering is what was born
Ignorance made me forlorn
Tearful truths I cannot scorn

Birth you gave was no thing ill
My heart is still, as time will tell.

After Great Pain, A Formal Feeling Comes
Emily Dickinson
After great pain, a formal feeling comes--
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Toombs--
The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?
 
The Feet, mechanical, go round--
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought--
A Wooden way
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone--
 
This is the Hour of Lead--
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons recollect the Snow--
First--Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go--

Edna St. Vincent Millay
I do but ask that you be always fair
That I forever may continue kind;
Knowing me what I am, you should not dare
To lapse from beauty ever, nor seek to bind
My alterable mood with lesser cords;
Weeping and such soft matters must invite
To further vagrancy; and bitter words
Chafe soon to irremediable flight,
Wherefore I pray you if you love me dearly,
Less dear to hold me than your own bright charms,
Whence it may fall that until death, or nearly,
I shall not move to struggle from your arms:
Fade if you must,--I would but bid you be
Like the sweet year, doing all things graciously.

Last nite I dreamed of T.S. Eliot
welcoming me to the land of dream
Sofas couches fog in England
Tea in his digs Chelsea rainbows
curtains on his windows, fog seeping in
the chimney but a nice warm house
and an incredibly sweet hooknosed
Eliot he loved me, put me up,
gave me a couch to sleep on,
conversed kindly, took me serious
asked my opinion on Mayakovsky
I read him Corso Creeley Kerouac
advised Burroughs Olson Huncke
the bearded lady in the Zoo, the
intelligent puma in Mexico City
6 chorus boys from Zanzibar
who chanted in wornout polygot
Swahili, and the rippling rythyms
of Ma Rainey and Vachel Lindsay.
On the Isle of the Queen
we had a long evening's conversation
Then he tucked me in my long
red underwear under a silken
blanket by the fire on the sofa
gave me English Hottie
and went off sadly to his bed,
Saying ah Ginsberg I am glad
to have met a fine young man like you.
At last, I woke ashamed of myself.
Is he that good and kind? Am I that great?
What's my motive dreaming his
manna? What English Department
would that impress? What failure
to be perfect prophet's made up here?
I dream of my kindness to T.S. Eliot
wanting to be a historical poet
and share in his finance of Imagery-
overambitious dream of eccentric boy.
God forbid my evil dreams come true.
Last nite I dreamed of Allen Ginsberg.
T.S. Eliot would've been ashamed of me.

This door you might not open, and you did;
So enter now, and see for what slight thing
You are betrayed.... Here is no treasure hid,
No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain
For greed like yours, no writhings of distress,
But only what you see.... Look yet again--
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless.
Yet this alone out of my life I kept
Unto myself, lest any know me quite;
And you did so profane me when you crept
Unto the threshold of this room to-night
That I must never more behold your face.
This now is yours. I seek another place.

Canto 
Ezra Pound
And then went down to the ship,
Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
Bore us onward with bellying canvas,
Crice's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day's end.
Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean,
Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities
Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
With glitter of sun-rays
Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven
Swartest night stretched over wreteched men there.
The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place
Aforesaid by Circe.
Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,
And drawing sword from my hip
I dug the ell-square pitkin;
Poured we libations unto each the dead,
First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads;
As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods,
A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep.
Dark blood flowed in the fosse,
Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides
Of youths and of the old who had borne much;
Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender,
Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,
These many crowded about me; with shouting,
Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;
Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine;
Unsheathed the narrow sword,
I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,
Till I should hear Tiresias.
But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,
Unburied, cast on the wide earth,
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
Unwept, unwrapped in the sepulchre, since toils urged other.
Pitiful spirit. And I cried in hurried speech:
""Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
""Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?""
        And he in heavy speech:
""Ill fate and abundant wine. I slept in Crice's ingle.
""Going down the long ladder unguarded,
""I fell against the buttress,

""Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.
""But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied,
""Heap up mine arms, be tomb by sea-bord, and inscribed:
""A man of no fortune, and with a name to come.
""And set my oar up, that I swung mid fellows.""
 
And Anticlea came, whom I beat off, and then Tiresias Theban,
Holding his golden wand, knew me, and spoke first:
""A second time? why? man of ill star,
""Facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
""Stand from the fosse, leave me my bloody bever
""For soothsay.""
        And I stepped back,
And he strong with the blood, said then: ""Odysseus
""Shalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
""Lose all companions."" Then Anticlea came.
Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus,
In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer.
And he sailed, by Sirens and thence outwards and away
And unto Crice.
        Venerandam,
In the Cretan's phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite,

Girdle and breat bands, thou with dark eyelids

The Terms in Which I Think of Reality
Allen Ginsberg
Reality is a question
of realizing how real
the world is already.
 
Time is Eternity,
ultimate and immovable;
everyone's an angel.
 
It's Heaven's mystery
of changing perfection :
absolute Eternity
 
changes! Cars are always
going down the street,
lamps go off and on.
 
It's a great flat plain;
we can see everything
on top of a table.
 
Clams open on the table,
lambs are eaten by worms
on the plain. The motion
 
of change is beautiful,
as well as form called
in and out of being.
 
Next : to distinguish process
in its particularity with
an eye to the initiation
 
of gratifying new changes
desired in the real world.
Here we're overwhelmed
 
with such unpleasant detail
we dream again of Heaven.
For the world is a mountain
 
of shit : if it's going to
be moved at all, it's got
to be taken by handfuls.
 
Man lives like the unhappy
whore on River Street who
in her Eternity gets only
 
a couple of bucks and a lot
of snide remarks in return

for seeking physical love
 
the best way she knows how,
never really heard of a glad
job or joyous marriage or
 
a difference in the heart :
or thinks it isn't for her,
which is her worst misery.

Because I could not stop for Death,

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.
 
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.
 
We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.
 
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound.
 
Since then 't is centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.

Tavern

I'll keep a little tavern
Below the high hill's crest,
Wherein all grey-eyed people
May set them down and rest.
 
There shall be plates a-plenty,
And mugs to melt the chill
Of all the grey-eyed people
Who happen up the hill.
 
There sound will sleep the traveller,
And dream his journey's end,
But I will rouse at midnight
The falling fire to tend.
 
Aye, 'tis a curious fancy -- 
But all the good I know
Was taught me out of two grey eyes
A long time ago.

That Day
Anne Sexton
This is the desk I sit at
and this is the desk where I love you too much
and this is the typewriter that sits before me
where yesterday only your body sat before me
with its shoulders gathered in like a Greek chorus,
with its tongue like a king making up rules as he goes,
with its tongue quite openly like a cat lapping milk,
with its tongue -- both of us coiled in its slippery life.
That was yesterday, that day.
That was the day of your tongue,
your tongue that came from your lips,
two openers, half animals, half birds
caught in the doorway of your heart.
That was the day I followed the king's rules,
passing by your red veins and your blue veins,
my hands down the backbone, down quick like a firepole,
hands between legs where you display your inner knowledge,
where diamond mines are buried and come forth to bury,
come forth more sudden than some reconstructed city.
It is complete within seconds, that monument.
The blood runs underground yet brings forth a tower.
A multitude should gather for such an edifice.
For a miracle one stands in line and throws confetti.
Surely The Press is here looking for headlines.
Surely someone should carry a banner on the sidewalk.
If a bridge is constructed doesn't the mayor cut a ribbon?
If a phenomenon arrives shouldn't the Magi come bearing gifts?
Yesterday was the day I bore gifts for your gift
and came from the valley to meet you on the pavement.
That was yesterday, that day.
That was the day of your face,
your face after love, close to the pillow, a lullaby.
Half asleep beside me letting the old fashioned rocker stop,
our breath became one, became a child-breath together,
while my fingers drew little o's on your shut eyes,
while my fingers drew little smiles on your mouth,
while I drew I LOVE YOU on your chest and its drummer
and whispered, ""Wake up!"" and you mumbled in your sleep,
""Sh. We're driving to Cape Cod. We're heading for the Bourne
Bridge. We're circling the Bourne Circle."" Bourne!
Then I knew you in your dream and prayed of our time
that I would be pierced and you would take root in me
and that I might bring forth your born, might bear
the you or the ghost of you in my little household.
Yesterday I did not want to be borrowed
but this is the typewriter that sits before me
and love is where yesterday is at.

O You Whom I Often And Silently Come
Walt Whitman
O YOU whom I often and silently come where you are, that I may be

Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is

Ils ont vu les Pays-Bas, ils rentrent à Terre Haute;
Mais une nuit d'été, les voici à Ravenne,
A l'sur le dos écartant les genoux
De quatre jambes molles tout gonflées de morsures.
On relève le drap pour mieux égratigner.
Moins d'une lieue d'ici est Saint Apollinaire
In Classe, basilique connue des amateurs
De chapitaux d'acanthe que touraoie le vent.
 
Ils vont prendre le train de huit heures
Prolonger leurs misères de Padoue à Milan
Ou se trouvent le Cène, et un restaurant pas cher.
Lui pense aux pourboires, et redige son bilan.
Ils auront vu la Suisse et traversé la France.
Et Saint Apollinaire, raide et ascétique,
Vieille usine désaffectée de Dieu, tient encore
Dans ses pierres ècroulantes la forme precise de Byzance.

Letter in November
Sylvia Plath
Love, the world
Suddenly turns, turns color. The streetlight
Splits through the rat's tail
Pods of the laburnum at nine in the morning.
It is the Arctic,
 
This little black
Circle, with its tawn silk grasses - babies hair.
There is a green in the air,
Soft, delectable.
It cushions me lovingly.
 
I am flushed and warm.
I think I may be enormous,
I am so stupidly happy,
My Wellingtons
Squelching and squelching through the beautiful red.
 
This is my property.
Two times a day
I pace it, sniffing
The barbarous holly with its viridian
Scallops, pure iron,
 
And the wall of the odd corpses.
I love them.
I love them like history.
The apples are golden,
Imagine it . . .
 
My seventy trees
Holding their gold-ruddy balls
In a thick gray death-soup,
Their million
Gold leaves metal and breathless.
 
O love, O celibate.
Nobody but me
Walks the waist high wet.
The irreplaceable
Golds bleed and deepen, the mouths of Thermopylae.

The Ad-Dressing Of Cats
Thomas Stearns Eliot
You've read of several kinds of Cat,
And my opinion now is that
You should need no interpreter
To understand their character.
You now have learned enough to see
That Cats are much like you and me
And other people whom we find
Possessed of various types of mind.
For some are same and some are mad
And some are good and some are bad
And some are better, some are worse--
But all may be described in verse.
You've seen them both at work and games,
And learnt about their proper names,
Their habits and their habitat:
But
How would you ad-dress a Cat?
 
So first, your memory I'll jog,
And say: A CAT IS NOT A DOG.
 
And you might now and then supply
Some caviare, or Strassburg Pie,
Some potted grouse, or salmon paste--
He's sure to have his personal taste.
(I know a Cat, who makes a habit
Of eating nothing else but rabbit,
And when he's finished, licks his paws
So's not to waste the onion sauce.)
A Cat's entitled to expect
These evidences of respect.
And so in time you reach your aim,
And finally call him by his NAME.
 
So this is this, and that is that:
And there's how you AD-DRESS A CAT.

Totem
Sylvia Plath
The engine is killing the track, the track is silver,
It stretches into the distance. It will be eaten nevertheless.
 
Its running is useless.
At nightfall there is the beauty of drowned fields,
 
Dawn gilds the farmers like pigs,
Swaying slightly in their thick suits,
 
White towers of Smithfield ahead,
Fat haunches and blood on their minds.
 
There is no mercy in the glitter of cleavers,
The butcher's guillotine that whispers: 'How's this, how's this?'
 
In the bowl the hare is aborted,
Its baby head out of the way, embalmed in spice,
 
Flayed of fur and humanity.
Let us eat it like Plato's afterbirth,
 
Let us eat it like Christ.
These are the people that were important ----
 
Their round eyes, their teeth, their grimaces
On a stick that rattles and clicks, a counterfeit snake.
 
Shall the hood of the cobra appall me ----
The loneliness of its eye, the eye of the mountains
 
Through which the sky eternally threads itself?
The world is blood-hot and personal
 
Dawn says, with its blood-flush.
There is no terminus, only suitcases
 
Out of which the same self unfolds like a suit
Bald and shiny, with pockets of wishes,
 
Notions and tickets, short circuits and folding mirrors.
I am mad, calls the spider, waving its many arms.
 
And in truth it is terrible,
Multiplied in the eyes of the flies.
 
They buzz like blue children
In nets of the infinite,
 
Roped in at the end by the one
Death with its many sticks.

AS the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,
A dread beyond, of I know not what, darkens me.
 
I shall go forth,
I shall traverse The States awhile--but I cannot tell whither or how

Perhaps soon, some day or night while I am singing, my voice will
suddenly cease.

Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?... And yet it is

A Woman Waits For Me
Walt Whitman
A WOMAN waits for me--she contains all, nothing is lacking,
Yet all were lacking, if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the
right man were lacking.
 
Sex contains all,
Bodies, Souls, meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results,
promulgations,
Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal
milk;
All hopes, benefactions, bestowals,
All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,
All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,
These are contain'd in sex, as parts of itself, and justifications of
itself.
 
Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his
sex, 
Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.
 
Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,
I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that
are warm-blooded and sufficient for me;
I see that they understand me, and do not deny me;
I see that they are worthy of me--I will be the robust husband of
those women.
 
They are not one jot less than I am,
They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,
Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,
They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike,
retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,
They are ultimate in their own right--they are calm, clear, well-
possess'd of themselves. 
 
I draw you close to me, you women!
I cannot let you go, I would do you good,
I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for
others' sakes;
Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,
They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.
 
It is I, you women--I make my way,
I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable--but I love you,
I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,
I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for These States--I
press with slow rude muscle,
I brace myself effectually--I listen to no entreaties, 
I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated
within me.
 
Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,

In you I wrap a thousand onward years,
On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,
The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new
artists, musicians, and singers,
The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,
I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,
I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you
interpenetrate now,
I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I
count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,
I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death,
immortality, I plant so lovingly now.

In white from head to foot,

Come Up From the Fields Father
Walt Whitman
Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,
And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy
dear son.
 
Lo, 'tis autumn,
Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the
moderate wind,
Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the
trellis'd vines,
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately
buzzing?)
 
Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain,
and with wondrous clouds,
Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm
prospers well.
 
Down in the fields all prospers well,
But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's
call,
And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right
away.
 
Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps
trembling,
She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.
 
Open the envelope quickly,
O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,
O a strange hand writes for our dear son, 0 stricken
mother's soul!
All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the
main words only,
Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry
skirmish, taken to hospital,
At present low, but will soon be better.
 
Ah now the single figure to me,
Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and
farms,
Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,
By the jamb of a door leans.
 
Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks
through her sobs,
The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.
Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to
be better, that brave and simple soul,)
While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,

The only son is dead.
 
But the mother needs to be better,
She with thin form presently drest in black,
By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping,
often waking,
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep
longing,
O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape
and withdraw,
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.

Thou art not lovelier than lilacs, -- no,
Nor honeysuckle; thou art not more fair
Than small white single poppies, -- I can bear
Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though
From left to right, not knowing where to go,
I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there
Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear
So has it been with mist, -- with moonlight so.
 
Like him who day by day unto his draught
Of delicate poison adds him one drop more
Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten,
Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed
Each hour more deeply than the hour before,
I drink -- and live -- what has destroyed some men.

The Moose
Elizabeth Bishop
<i>For Grace Bulmer Bowers</i>
 
From narrow provinces
of fish and bread and tea,
home of the long tides
where the bay leaves the sea
twice a day and takes
the herrings long rides,
 
where if the river
enters or retreats
in a wall of brown foam
depends on if it meets
the bay coming in,
the bay not at home;
 
where, silted red,
sometimes the sun sets
facing a red sea,
and others, veins the flats'
lavender, rich mud
in burning rivulets;
 
on red, gravelly roads,
down rows of sugar maples,
past clapboard farmhouses
and neat, clapboard churches,
bleached, ridged as clamshells,
past twin silver birches,
 
through late afternoon
a bus journeys west,
the windshield flashing pink,
pink glancing off of metal,
brushing the dented flank
of blue, beat-up enamel;
 
down hollows, up rises,
and waits, patient, while
a lone traveller gives
kisses and embraces
to seven relatives
and a collie supervises.
 
Goodbye to the elms,
to the farm, to the dog.
The bus starts. The light
grows richer; the fog,
shifting, salty, thin,
comes closing in.

Its cold, round crystals
form and slide and settle
in the white hens' feathers,
in gray glazed cabbages,
on the cabbage roses
and lupins like apostles;
 
the sweet peas cling
to their wet white string
on the whitewashed fences;
bumblebees creep
inside the foxgloves,
and evening commences.
 
One stop at Bass River.
Then the Economies
Lower, Middle, Upper;
Five Islands, Five Houses,
where a woman shakes a tablecloth
out after supper.
 
A pale flickering. Gone.
The Tantramar marshes
and the smell of salt hay.
An iron bridge trembles
and a loose plank rattles
but doesn't give way.
 
On the left, a red light
swims through the dark:
a ship's port lantern.
Two rubber boots show,
illuminated, solemn.
A dog gives one bark.
 
A woman climbs in
with two market bags,
brisk, freckled, elderly.
""A grand night. Yes, sir,
all the way to Boston.""
She regards us amicably.
 
Moonlight as we enter
the New Brunswick woods,
hairy, scratchy, splintery;
moonlight and mist
caught in them like lamb's wool
on bushes in a pasture.
 
The passengers lie back.
Snores. Some long sighs.
A dreamy divagation

begins in the night,
a gentle, auditory,
slow hallucination. . . .
 
In the creakings and noises,
an old conversation
--not concerning us,
but recognizable, somewhere,
back in the bus:
Grandparents' voices
 
uninterruptedly
talking, in Eternity:
names being mentioned,
things cleared up finally;
what he said, what she said,
who got pensioned;
 
deaths, deaths and sicknesses;
the year he remarried;
the year (something) happened.
She died in childbirth.
That was the son lost
when the schooner foundered.
 
He took to drink. Yes.
She went to the bad.
When Amos began to pray
even in the store and
finally the family had
to put him away.
 
""Yes . . ."" that peculiar
affirmative. ""Yes . . .""
A sharp, indrawn breath,
half groan, half acceptance,
that means ""Life's like that.
We know it (also death).""
 
Talking the way they talked
in the old featherbed,
peacefully, on and on,
dim lamplight in the hall,
down in the kitchen, the dog
tucked in her shawl.
 
Now, it's all right now
even to fall asleep
just as on all those nights.
--Suddenly the bus driver
stops with a jolt,
turns off his lights.

A moose has come out of
the impenetrable wood
and stands there, looms, rather,
in the middle of the road.
It approaches; it sniffs at
the bus's hot hood.
 
Towering, antlerless,
high as a church,
homely as a house
(or, safe as houses).
A man's voice assures us
""Perfectly harmless. . . .""
 
Some of the passengers
exclaim in whispers,
childishly, softly,
""Sure are big creatures.""
""It's awful plain.""
""Look! It's a she!""
 
Taking her time,
she looks the bus over,
grand, otherworldly.
Why, why do we feel
(we all feel) this sweet
sensation of joy?
 
""Curious creatures,""
says our quiet driver,
rolling his r's.
""Look at that, would you.""
Then he shifts gears.
For a moment longer,
 
by craning backward,
the moose can be seen
on the moonlit macadam;
then there's a dim
smell of moose, an acrid
smell of gasoline.

Here is a wound that never will heal, I know,
Being wrought not of a dearness and a death,
But of a love turned ashes and the breath
Gone out of beauty; never again will grow
The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow
Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath
Its friendly weathers down, far Underneath
Shall be such bitterness of an old woe.
That April should be shattered by a gust,
That August should be levelled by a rain,

Of man should settle to the earth again;
But that a dream can die, will be a thrust
Between my ribs forever of hot pain.

To the music of rustling leaves, kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas

Mortally wounded he, and buried on the retreat, (easily all could I

left,
On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,

Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering;
Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life;
Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in

Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave--comes the inscription
rude in Virginia's woods,
Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.

Song for the Rainy Season
Elizabeth Bishop
Hidden, oh hidden
in the high fog
the house we live in,
beneath the magnetic rock,
rain-, rainbow-ridden,
where blood-black
bromelias, lichens,
owls, and the lint
of the waterfalls cling,
familiar, unbidden.
 
In a dim age
of water
the brook sings loud
from a rib cage
of giant fern; vapor
climbs up the thick growth
effortlessly, turns back,
holding them both,
house and rock,
in a private cloud.
 
At night, on the roof,
blind drops crawl
and the ordinary brown
owl gives us proof
he can count:
five times--always five--
he stamps and takes off
after the fat frogs that,
shrilling for love,
clamber and mount.
 
House, open house
to the white dew
and the milk-white sunrise
kind to the eyes,
to membership
of silver fish, mouse,
bookworms,
big moths; with a wall
for the mildew's
ignorant map;
 
darkened and tarnished
by the warm touch
of the warm breath,
maculate, cherished;
rejoice! For a later
era will differ.
(O difference that kills
or intimidates, much

of all our small shadowy
life!) Without water
 
the great rock will stare
unmagnetized, bare,
no longer wearing
rainbows or rain,
the forgiving air
and the high fog gone;
the owls will move on
and the several
waterfalls shrivel
in the steady sun.

A speck that would have been beneath my sight
On any but a paper sheet so white
Set off across what I had written there.
And I had idly poised my pen in air
To stop it with a period of ink
When something strange about it made me think,
This was no dust speck by my breathing blown,
But unmistakably a living mite
With inclinations it could call its own.
It paused as with suspicion of my pen,
And then came racing wildly on again
To where my manuscript was not yet dry;
Then paused again and either drank or smelt--
With loathing, for again it turned to fly.
Plainly with an intelligence I dealt.
It seemed too tiny to have room for feet,
Yet must have had a set of them complete
To express how much it didn't want to die.
It ran with terror and with cunning crept.
It faltered: I could see it hesitate;
Then in the middle of the open sheet
Cower down in desperation to accept
Whatever I accorded it of fate.
I have none of the tenderer-than-thou
Collectivistic regimenting love
With which the modern world is being swept.
But this poor microscopic item now!
Since it was nothing I knew evil of
I let it lie there till I hope it slept.
I have a mind myself and recognize
Mind when I meet with it in any guise
No one can know how glad I am to find
On any sheet the least display of mind.

Sonnets 04: Only Until This Cigarette Is Ended
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Only until this cigarette is ended,
A little moment at the end of all,
While on the floor the quiet ashes fall,
And in the firelight to a lance extended,
Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended,
The broken shadow dances on the wall,
I will permit my memory to recall
The vision of you, by all my dreams attended.
And then adieu, -- farewell! -- the dream is done.
Yours is a face of which I can forget
The color and the features, every one,
The words not ever, and the smiles not yet;
But in your day this moment is the sun
Upon a hill, after the sun has set.

Louise Gluck
I'll tell you something: every day
people are dying. And that's just the beginning.
Every day, in funeral homes, new widows are born,
new orphans. They sit with their hands folded,
trying to decide about this new life.
 
Then they're in the cemetery, some of them
for the first time. They're frightened of crying,
sometimes of not crying. Someone leans over,
tells them what to do next, which might mean
saying a few words, sometimes
throwing dirt in the open grave.
 
And after that, everyone goes back to the house,
which is suddenly full of visitors.
The widow sits on the couch, very stately,
so people line up to approach her,
sometimes take her hand, sometimes embrace her.
She finds something to say to everbody,
thanks them, thanks them for coming.
 
In her heart, she wants them to go away.
She wants to be back in the cemetery,
back in the sickroom, the hospital. She knows
it isn't possible. But it's her only hope,
the wish to move backward. And just a little,
not so far as the marriage, the first kiss.

Tract
William Carlos Williams
I will teach you my townspeople
how to perform a funeral
for you have it over a troop
of artists-
unless one should scour the world-
you have the ground sense necessary.
 
See! the hearse leads.
I begin with a design for a hearse.
For Christ's sake not black-
nor white either - and not polished!
Let it be whethered - like a farm wagon -
with gilt wheels (this could be
applied fresh at small expense)
or no wheels at all:
a rough dray to drag over the ground.
 
Knock the glass out!
My God - glass, my townspeople!
For what purpose? Is it for the dead
to look out or for us to see
the flowers or the lack of them -
or what?
To keep the rain and snow from him?
He will have a heavier rain soon:
pebbles and dirt and what not.
Let there be no glass -
and no upholstery, phew!
and no little brass rollers
and small easy wheels on the bottom -
my townspeople, what are you thinking of?
A rough plain hearse then
with gilt wheels and no top at all.
On this the coffin lies
by its own weight.
 
No wreathes please-
especially no hot house flowers.
Some common memento is better,
something he prized and is known by:
his old clothes - a few books perhaps -
God knows what! You realize
how we are about these things
my townspeople -
something will be found - anything
even flowers if he had come to that.
So much for the hearse.
 
For heaven's sake though see to the driver!
Take off the silk hat! In fact
that's no place at all for him -
up there unceremoniously

dragging our friend out to his own dignity!
Bring him down - bring him down!
Low and inconspicuous! I'd not have him ride
on the wagon at all - damn him! -
the undertaker's understrapper!
Let him hold the reins
and walk at the side
and inconspicuously too!
 
Then briefly as to yourselves:
Walk behind - as they do in France,
seventh class, or if you ride
Hell take curtains! Go with some show
of inconvenience; sit openly -
to the weather as to grief.
Or do you think you can shut grief in?
What - from us? We who have perhaps
nothing to lose? Share with us
share with us - it will be money
in your pockets.
Go now
I think you are ready.

The Starry Night
Anne Sexton
""That does not keep me from having a terrible need of -- shall I say the word --
religion. Then I go out at night to paint the stars.""
-- Vincent Van Gogh in a letter to his brother
 
The town does not exist
except where one black-haired tree slips
up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.
The town is silent. The night boils with eleven stars.
Oh starry night! This is how
I want to die.
 
It moves. They are all alive.
Even the moon bulges in its orange irons
to push children, like a god, from its eye.
The old unseen serpent swallows up the stars.
Oh starry starry night! This is how
I want to die:
 
into that rushing beast of the night,
sucked up by that great dragon, to split
from my life with no flag,
no belly,
no cry.

First Death In Nova Scotia
Elizabeth Bishop
In the cold, cold parlor
my mother laid out Arthur
beneath the chromographs:
Edward, Prince of Wales,
with Princess Alexandra,
and King George with Queen Mary.
Below them on the table
stood a stuffed loon
shot and stuffed by Uncle
Arthur, Arthur's father.
 
Since Uncle Arthur fired
a bullet into him,
he hadn't said a word.
He kept his own counsel
on his white, frozen lake,
the marble-topped table.
His breast was deep and white,
cold and caressable;
his eyes were red glass,
much to be desired.
 
""Come,"" said my mother,
""Come and say good-bye
to your little cousin Arthur.""
I was lifted up and given
one lily of the valley
to put in Arthur's hand.
Arthur's coffin was
a little frosted cake,
and the red-eyed loon eyed it
from his white, frozen lake.
 
Arthur was very small.
He was all white, like a doll
that hadn't been painted yet.
Jack Frost had started to paint him
the way he always painted
the Maple Leaf (Forever).
He had just begun on his hair,
a few red strokes, and then
Jack Frost had dropped the brush
and left him white, forever.
 
The gracious royal couples
were warm in red and ermine;
their feet were well wrapped up
in the ladies' ermine trains.
They invited Arthur to be
the smallest page at court.
But how could Arthur go,
clutching his tiny lily,

with his eyes shut up so tight
and the roads deep in snow?

Kaddish, Part I
Allen Ginsberg
Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes, while I walk on
the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village.
downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I've been up all night, talking,
talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues
shout blind on the phonograph
the rhythm the rhythm--and your memory in my head three years after--
And read Adonais' last triumphant stanzas aloud--wept, realizing
how we suffer--
And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember,
prophesy as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist Book of An-
swers--and my own imagination of a withered leaf--at dawn--
Dreaming back thru life, Your time--and mine accelerating toward Apoca-
lypse,
the final moment--the flower burning in the Day--and what comes after,
looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city
a flash away, and the great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom
Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed--
like a poem in the dark--escaped back to Oblivion--
No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream,
trapped in its disappearance,
sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, worship-
ping each other,
worshipping the God included in it all--longing or inevitability?--while it
lasts, a Vision--anything more?
It leaps about me, as I go out and walk the street, look back over my shoulder,
Seventh Avenue, the battlements of window office buildings shoul-
dering each other high, under a cloud, tall as the sky an instant--and
the sky above--an old blue place.
or down the Avenue to the south, to--as I walk toward the Lower East Side
--where you walked 50 years ago, little girl--from Russia, eating the
first poisonous tomatoes of America frightened on the dock
then struggling in the crowds of Orchard Street toward what?--toward
Newark--
toward candy store, first home-made sodas of the century, hand-churned ice
cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards--
Toward education marriage nervous breakdown, operation, teaching school,
and learning to be mad, in a dream--what is this life?
Toward the Key in the window--and the great Key lays its head of light
on top of Manhattan, and over the floor, and lays down on the
sidewalk--in a single vast beam, moving, as I walk down First toward
the Yiddish Theater--and the place of poverty
you knew, and I know, but without caring now--Strange to have moved
thru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again,
with the cries of Spaniards now in the doorstops doors and dark boys on
the street, firs escapes old as you
--Tho you're not old now, that's left here with me--
Myself, anyhow, maybe as old as the universe--and I guess that dies with
us--enough to cancel all that comes--What came is gone forever
every time--
That's good!That leaves it open for no regret--no fear radiators, lacklove,
torture even toothache in the end--
Though while it comes it is a lion that eats the soul--and the lamb, the soul,

in us, alas, offering itself in sacrifice to change's fierce hunger--hair
and teeth--and the roar of bonepain, skull bare, break rib, rot-skin,
braintricked Implacability.
Ai! ai!we do worse! We are in a fix!And you're out, Death let you out,
Death had the Mercy, you're done with your century, done with
God, done with the path thru it--Done with yourself at last--Pure
--Back to the Babe dark before your Father, before us all--before the
world--
There, rest.No more suffering for you.I know where you've gone, it's good.
No more flowers in the summer fields of New York, no joy now, no more
fear of Louis,
and no more of his sweetness and glasses, his high school decades, debts,
loves, frightened telephone calls, conception beds, relatives, hands--
No more of sister Elanor,--she gone before you--we kept it secret you
killed her--or she killed herself to bear with you--an arthritic heart
--But Death's killed you both--No matter--
Nor your memory of your mother, 1915 tears in silent movies weeks and
weeks--forgetting, agrieve watching Marie Dressler address human-
ity, Chaplin dance in youth,
or Boris Godunov, Chaliapin's at the Met, halling his voice of a weeping Czar
--by standing room with Elanor & Max--watching also the Capital
ists take seats in Orchestra, white furs, diamonds,
with the YPSL's hitch-hiking thru Pennsylvania, in black baggy gym skirts
pants, photograph of 4 girls holding each other round the waste, and
laughing eye, too coy, virginal solitude of 
all girls grown old, or dead now, and that long hair in the grave--lucky to
have husbands later--
You made it--I came too--Eugene my brother before (still grieving now and
will gream on to his last stiff hand, as he goes thru his cancer--or kill
--later perhaps--soon he will think--)
And it's the last moment I remember, which I see them all, thru myself, now
--tho not you
I didn't foresee what you felt--what more hideous gape of bad mouth came
first--to you--and were you prepared?
To go where?In that Dark--that--in that God? a radiance? A Lord in the
Void?Like an eye in the black cloud in a dream?Adonoi at last, with
you?
Beyond my remembrance! Incapable to guess! Not merely the yellow skull
in the grave, or a box of worm dust, and a stained ribbon--Deaths-
head with Halo?can you believe it?
Is it only the sun that shines once for the mind, only the flash of existence,
than none ever was?
Nothing beyond what we have--what you had--that so pitiful--yet Tri-
umph,
to have been here, and changed, like a tree, broken, or flower--fed to the
ground--but made, with its petals, colored, thinking Great Universe,
shaken, cut in the head, leaf stript, hid in an egg crate hospital, cloth
wrapped, sore--freaked in the moon brain, Naughtless.
No flower like that flower, which knew itself in the garden, and fought the
knife--lost
Cut down by an idiot Snowman's icy--even in the Spring--strange ghost
thought some--Death--Sharp icicle in his hand--crowned with old

roses--a dog for his eyes--cock of a sweatshop--heart of electric
irons.
All the accumulations of life, that wear us out--clocks, bodies, consciousness,
shoes, breasts--begotten sons--your Communism--'Paranoia' into
hospitals.
You once kicked Elanor in the leg, she died of heart failure later.You of
stroke.Asleep?within a year, the two of you, sisters in death.Is
Elanor happy?
Max grieves alive in an office on Lower Broadway, lone large mustache over
midnight Accountings, not sure.His life passes--as he sees--and
what does he doubt now?Still dream of making money, or that might
have made money, hired nurse, had children, found even your Im-
mortality, Naomi?
I'll see him soon.Now I've got to cut through to talk to you as I didn't
when you had a mouth.
Forever.And we're bound for that, Forever like Emily Dickinson's horses
--headed to the End.
They know the way--These Steeds--run faster than we think--it's our own
life they cross--and take with them.
 
Magnificent, mourned no more, marred of heart, mind behind, mar-
ried dreamed, mortal changed--Ass and face done with murder.
In the world, given, flower maddened, made no Utopia, shut under
pine, almed in Earth, blamed in Lone, Jehovah, accept.
Nameless, One Faced, Forever beyond me, beginningless, endless,
Father in death.Tho I am not there for this Prophecy, I am unmarried, I'm
hymnless, I'm Heavenless, headless in blisshood I would still adore
Thee, Heaven, after Death, only One blessed in Nothingness, not
light or darkness, Dayless Eternity--
Take this, this Psalm, from me, burst from my hand in a day, some
of my Time, now given to Nothing--to praise Thee--But Death
This is the end, the redemption from Wilderness, way for the Won-
derer, House sought for All, black handkerchief washed clean by weeping
--page beyond Psalm--Last change of mine and Naomi--to God's perfect
Darkness--Death, stay thy phantoms!
 
II
Over and over--refrain--of the Hospitals--still haven't written your
history--leave it abstract--a few images
run thru the mind--like the saxophone chorus of houses and years--
remembrance of electrical shocks.
By long nites as a child in Paterson apartment, watching over your
nervousness--you were fat--your next move--
By that afternoon I stayed home from school to take care of you--
once and for all--when I vowed forever that once man disagreed with my
opinion of the cosmos, I was lost--
By my later burden--vow to illuminate mankind--this is release of
particulars--(mad as you)--(sanity a trick of agreement)--
But you stared out the window on the Broadway Church corner, and
spied a mystical assassin from Newark,
So phoned the Doctor--'OK go way for a rest'--so I put on my coat
and walked you downstreet--On the way a grammarschool boy screamed,

unaccountably--'Where you goin Lady to Death'? I shuddered--
and you covered your nose with motheaten fur collar, gas mask
against poison sneaked into downtown atmosphere, sprayed by Grandma--
And was the driver of the cheesebox Public Service bus a member of
the gang?You shuddered at his face, I could hardly get you on--to New

When the tempests kill the earth's foul peace,

My words for stour, hath no blood of crimson

Yea, I fill all the air with my music.

And our charges 'gainst ""The Leopard's"" rush clash.
May God damn for ever all who cry ""Peace!""

And used her gentle doves with manners rude;

What fury urged him slay
Her antelope who meant him naught but good.
 
She spoke most chiding in his ear
Till he some pity took upon her crying;
Of rich attire
He made her shoulders bare
And solaced her, but quit her at cock's crowing.
 
A hundred heralds she sent out
To summon in her slight all doughty men
Whose force might fit
Shape of her sleep, her thought-
None of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown.
 
So she is come to this rare pass
Whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall
And sings you thus :

Cigarettes And Whiskey And Wild, Wild Women
Anne Sexton
(from a song)
 
Perhaps I was born kneeling,
born coughing on the long winter,
born expecting the kiss of mercy,
born with a passion for quickness
and yet, as things progressed,
I learned early about the stockade
or taken out, the fume of the enema.
By two or three I learned not to kneel,
not to expect, to plant my fires underground
where none but the dolls, perfect and awful,
could be whispered to or laid down to die.
 
Now that I have written many words,
and let out so many loves, for so many,
and been altogether what I always was—
a woman of excess, of zeal and greed,
I find the effort useless.
Do I not look in the mirror,
these days,
and see a drunken rat avert her eyes?
Do I not feel the hunger so acutely
that I would rather die than look
into its face?
I kneel once more,
in case mercy should come
in the nick of time.

After Apple Picking
Robert Frost
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still.
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples; I am drowsing off.
I cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the water-trough,
And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take.
Magnified apples appear and reappear,
Stem end and blossom end,
And every fleck of russet showing clear.
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
And I keep hearing from the cellar-bin
That rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in.
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking; I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired.
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,
For all
That struck the earth,
No matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble,
Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth.
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
Were he not gone,
The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
Or just some human sleep.

Apostroph
Walt Whitman
O MATER! O fils!
O brood continental!
O flowers of the prairies!
O space boundless! O hum of mighty products!
O you teeming cities! O so invincible, turbulent, proud!
O race of the future! O women!
O fathers! O you men of passion and the storm!
O native power only! O beauty!
O yourself! O God! O divine average!
O you bearded roughs! O bards! O all those slumberers! 
O arouse! the dawn bird's throat sounds shrill! Do you not hear the
cock crowing?
O, as I walk'd the beach, I heard the mournful notes foreboding a
tempest--the low, oft-repeated shriek of the diver, the long-
lived loon;
O I heard, and yet hear, angry thunder;--O you sailors! O ships! make
quick preparation!
O from his masterful sweep, the warning cry of the eagle!
(Give way there, all! It is useless! Give up your spoils;)
O sarcasms! Propositions! (O if the whole world should prove indeed a
sham, a sell!)
O I believe there is nothing real but America and freedom!
O to sternly reject all except Democracy!
O imperator! O who dare confront you and me?
O to promulgate our own! O to build for that which builds for
mankind! 
O feuillage! O North! O the slope drained by the Mexican sea!
O all, all inseparable--ages, ages, ages!
O a curse on him that would dissever this Union for any reason
whatever!
O climates, labors! O good and evil! O death!
O you strong with iron and wood! O Personality!
O the village or place which has the greatest man or woman! even if
it be only a few ragged huts;
O the city where women walk in public processions in the streets, the
same as the men;
O a wan and terrible emblem, by me adopted!
O shapes arising! shapes of the future centuries!
O muscle and pluck forever for me! 
O workmen and workwomen forever for me!
O farmers and sailors! O drivers of horses forever for me!
O I will make the new bardic list of trades and tools!
O you coarse and wilful! I love you!
O South! O longings for my dear home! O soft and sunny airs!
O pensive! O I must return where the palm grows and the mocking-bird
sings, or else I die!
O equality! O organic compacts! I am come to be your born poet!
O whirl, contest, sounding and resounding! I am your poet, because I
am part of you;
O days by-gone! Enthusiasts! Antecedents!
O vast preparations for These States! O years! 
O what is now being sent forward thousands of years to come!

O mediums! O to teach! to convey the invisible faith!
To promulge real things! to journey through all The States!
O creation! O to-day! O laws! O unmitigated adoration!
O for mightier broods of orators, artists, and singers!
O for native songs! carpenter's, boatman's, ploughman's songs!
shoemaker's songs!
O haughtiest growth of time! O free and extatic!
O what I, here, preparing, warble for!
O you hastening light! O the sun of the world will ascend, dazzling,
and take his height--and you too will ascend;
O so amazing and so broad! up there resplendent, darting and
burning; 
O prophetic! O vision staggered with weight of light! with pouring
glories!
O copious! O hitherto unequalled!
O Libertad! O compact! O union impossible to dissever!
O my Soul! O lips becoming tremulous, powerless!
O centuries, centuries yet ahead!
O voices of greater orators! I pause--I listen for you
O you States! Cities! defiant of all outside authority! I spring at
once into your arms! you I most love!
O you grand Presidentiads! I wait for you!
New history! New heroes! I project you!
Visions of poets! only you really last! O sweep on! sweep on! 
O Death! O you striding there! O I cannot yet!
O heights! O infinitely too swift and dizzy yet!

Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth
Emily Dickinson

 
Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth--
Widths out of the Sun--
And look--and shudder, and block your breath--
And deem to be alone
 
In such a place, what horror,
How Goblin it would be--
And fly, as 'twere pursuing you?
Then Loneliness--looks so--
 
Did you ever look in a Cannon's face--
Between whose Yellow eye--
And yours--the Judgment intervened--
The Question of ""To die""--
 
Extemporizing in your ear
As cool as Satyr's Drums--
If you remember, and were saved--
It's liker so--it seems--

Revelation
Robert Frost
We make ourselves a place apart
Behind light words that tease and flout,
But oh, the agitated heart
Till someone find us really out.
'Tis pity if the case require
(Or so we say) that in the end
We speak the literal to inspire
The understanding of a friend.
But so with all, from babes that play
At hide-and-seek to God afar,
So all who hide too well away
Must speak and tell us where they are.

Eidólons
Walt Whitman
I MET a Seer,
Passing the hues and objects of the world,
The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,
To glean Eidólons.
 
Put in thy chants, said he,
No more the puzzling hour, nor day--nor segments, parts, put in,
Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance-song of
all,
That of Eidólons.
 
Ever the dim beginning;
Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle; 
Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)
Eidólons! Eidólons!
 
Ever the mutable!
Ever materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering;
Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,
Issuing Eidólons!
 
Lo! I or you!
Or woman, man, or State, known or unknown,
We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,
But really build Eidólons. 
 
The ostent evanescent;
The substance of an artist's mood, or savan's studies long,
Or warrior's, martyr's, hero's toils,
To fashion his Eidólon.
 
Of every human life,
(The units gather'd, posted--not a thought, emotion, deed, left out;)
The whole, or large or small, summ'd, added up,
In its Eidólon.
 
The old, old urge;
Based on the ancient pinnacles, lo! newer, higher pinnacles; 
From Science and the Modern still impell'd,
The old, old urge, Eidólons.
 
The present, now and here,
America's busy, teeming, intricate whirl,
Of aggregate and segregate, for only thence releasing,
To-day's Eidólons.
 
These, with the past,
Of vanish'd lands--of all the reigns of kings across the sea,
Old conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors' voyages,
Joining Eidólons. 
 
Densities, growth, façades,

Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,
Far-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,
Eidólons everlasting.
 
Exaltè, rapt, extatic,
The visible but their womb of birth,
Of orbic tendencies to shape, and shape, and shape,
The mighty Earth-Eidólon.
 
All space, all time,
(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns, 
Swelling, collapsing, ending--serving their longer, shorter use,)
Fill'd with Eidólons only.
 
The noiseless myriads!
The infinite oceans where the rivers empty!
The separate, countless free identities, like eyesight;
The true realities, Eidólons.
 
Not this the World,
Nor these the Universes--they the Universes,
Purport and end--ever the permanent life of life,
Eidólons, Eidólons. 
 
Beyond thy lectures, learn'd professor,
Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope, observer keen--beyond all
mathematics,
Beyond the doctor's surgery, anatomy--beyond the chemist with his
chemistry,
The entities of entities, Eidólons.
 
Unfix'd, yet fix'd;
Ever shall be--ever have been, and are,
Sweeping the present to the infinite future,
Eidólons, Eidólons, Eidólons.
 
The prophet and the bard,
Shall yet maintain themselves--in higher stages yet, 
Shall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy--interpret yet to them,
God, and Eidólons.
 
And thee, My Soul!
Joys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations!
Thy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,
Thy mates, Eidólons.
 
Thy Body permanent,
The Body lurking there within thy Body,
The only purport of the Form thou art--the real I myself,
An image, an Eidólon. 
 
Thy very songs, not in thy songs;

No special strains to sing--none for itself;
But from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,
A round, full-orb'd Eidólon.

Waiting
William Carlos Williams
When I am alone I am happy.
The air is cool. The sky is
flecked and splashed and wound
with color. The crimson phalloi
of the sassafras leaves
hang crowded before me
in shoals on the heavy branches.
When I reach my doorstep
I am greeted by
the happy shrieks of my children
and my heart sinks.
I am crushed.
 
Are not my children as dear to me
as falling leaves or
must one become stupid
to grow older?
It seems much as if Sorrow
had tripped up my heels.
Let us see, let us see!
What did I plan to say to her
when it should happen to me
as it has happened now?

""Arcturus"" is his other name—

Murmured ""Resurgam""—""Centipede""!
""Oh Lord—how frail are we""!
 
I pull a flower from the woods—
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath—
And has her in a ""class""!
 
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat—
He sits erect in ""Cabinets""—
The Clover bells forgot.
 
What once was ""Heaven""
Is ""Zenith"" now—
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
 
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for ""the worst""—
Whatever prank betides!
 
Perhaps the ""Kingdom of Heaven's"" changed—
I hope the ""Children"" there Won't be ""new fashioned"" when I come—
And laugh at me—and stare—

Will lift his little girl—
Old fashioned—naught—everything—
Over the stile of ""Pearl.""

For Once, Then, Something
Robert Frost
Others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
Always wrong to the light, so never seeing
Deeper down in the well than where the water
Gives me back in a shining surface picture
Me myself in the summer heaven godlike
Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs.
Once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,
I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture,
Through the picture, a something white, uncertain,
Something more of the depths--and then I lost it.
Water came to rebuke the too clear water.
One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple
Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,
Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness?
Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, something.

Only until this cigarette is ended
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Only until this cigarette is ended,
A little moment at the end of all,
While on the floor the quiet ashes fall,
And in the firelight to a lance extended,
Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended,
The broken shadow dances on the wall,
I will permit my memory to recall
The vision of you, by all my dreams attended.
And then adieu,--farewell!--the dream is done.
Yours is a face of which I can forget
The colour and the features, every one,
The words not ever, and the smiles not yet;
But in your day this moment is the sun
Upon a hill, after the sun has set.

Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)

Or an old battered lantern hung aloft
To light poor travellers to their distress.'

And I then: 'Some one frames upon the keys
That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain
The night and moonshine; music which we seize
To body forth our vacuity.'
She then: 'Does this refer to me?'
'Oh no, it is I who am inane.'
 
'You, madam, are the eternal humorist,
The eternal enemy of the absolute,
Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!
With your aid indifferent and imperious
At a stroke our mad poetics to confute--'
And--'Are we then so serious?'

And leave the soul alone.

cars parked outside in shade

at 3 A.M. the blast of loudspeakers
hi-fi Rolling Stones Ray Charles Beatles
Jumping Joe Jackson and twenty youths
dancing to the vibration thru the floor,
a little weed in the bathroom, girls in scarlet
tights, one muscular smooth skinned man
sweating dancing for hours, beer cans
bent littering the yard, a hanged man
sculpture dangling from a high creek branch,
children sleeping softly in their bedroom bunks.
And 4 police cars parked outside the painted

My heart is what it was before,
A house where people come and go;
But it is winter with your love,
The sashes are beset with snow.
 
I light the lamp and lay the cloth,
I blow the coals to blaze again;
But it is winter with your love,
The frost is thick upon the pane..
 
I know a winter when it comes:
The leaves are listless on the boughs;
I watched your love a little while,
And brought my plants into the house.
 
I water them and turn them south,
I snap the dead brown from the stem;
But it is winter with your love,
I only tend and water them.
 
There was a time I stood and watched
The small, ill-natured sparrows' fray;
I loved the beggar that I fed,
I cared for what he had to say,
 
I stood and watched him out of sight:
Today I reach around the door
And set a bowl upon the step;
My heart is what it was before,
 
But it is winter with your love;
I scatter crumbs upon the sill,
And close the window, -- and the birds
May take or leave them, as they will.

Sleep in the Mojave Desert
Sylvia Plath
Out here there are no hearthstones,
Hot grains, simply. It is dry, dry.
And the air dangerous. Noonday acts queerly
On the mind's eye erecting a line
Of poplars in the middle distance, the only
Object beside the mad, straight road
One can remember men and houses by.
A cool wind should inhabit these leaves
And a dew collect on them, dearer than money,
In the blue hour before sunup.
Yet they recede, untouchable as tomorrow,
Or those glittery fictions of spilt water
That glide ahead of the very thirsty.
 
I think of the lizards airing their tongues
In the crevice of an extremely small shadow
And the toad guarding his heart's droplet.
The desert is white as a blind man's eye,
Comfortless as salt. Snake and bird
Doze behind the old maskss of fury.
We swelter like firedogs in the wind.
The sun puts its cinder out. Where we lie
The heat-cracked crickets congregate
In their black armorplate and cry.
The day-moon lights up like a sorry mother,
And the crickets come creeping into our hair
To fiddle the short night away.

One day 3 poets and 60 ears sat under a green-striped Chau-

listening to Black spirituals, tapping their feet, appreciating
words singing by in mountain winds
on a pleasant sunny day of rest -- the wild wind blew thru
blue Heavens
filled with fluffy clouds stretched from Central City to Rocky

hot dogs sizzled in the Lion's Club lunchwagon microwave
mouth, orangeade bubbled over in waxen cups
Traffic moved along Colefax, meditators silent in the Diamond
Castle shrine-room at Boulder followed the breath going
out of their nostrils,
Nobody could remember anything, spirits flew out of mouths
&amp; noses, out of the sky, across Colorado plains &amp; the
tent flapped happily open spacious &amp; didn't fall down.

Looking Across the Fields and Watching the Birds Fly
Wallace Stevens
Among the more irritating minor ideas
Of Mr. Homburg during his visits home
To Concord, at the edge of things, was this:
 
To think away the grass, the trees, the clouds,
Not to transform them into other things,
Is only what the sun does every day,
 
Until we say to ourselves that there may be
A pensive nature, a mechanical
And slightly detestable operandum, free
 
From man's ghost, larger and yet a little like,
Without his literature and without his gods . . .
No doubt we live beyond ourselves in air,
 
In an element that does not do for us,
so well, that which we do for ourselves, too big,
A thing not planned for imagery or belief,
 
Not one of the masculine myths we used to make,
A transparency through which the swallow weaves,
Without any form or any sense of form,
 
What we know in what we see, what we feel in what
We hear, what we are, beyond mystic disputation,
In the tumult of integrations out of the sky,
 
And what we think, a breathing like the wind,
A moving part of a motion, a discovery
Part of a discovery, a change part of a change,
 
A sharing of color and being part of it.
The afternoon is visibly a source,
Too wide, too irised, to be more than calm,
 
Too much like thinking to be less than thought,
Obscurest parent, obscurest patriarch,
A daily majesty of meditation,
 
That comes and goes in silences of its own.
We think, then as the sun shines or does not.
We think as wind skitters on a pond in a field
 
Or we put mantles on our words because
The same wind, rising and rising, makes a sound
Like the last muting of winter as it ends.
 
A new scholar replacing an older one reflects
A moment on this fantasia. He seeks
For a human that can be accounted for.

The spirit comes from the body of the world,
Or so Mr. Homburg thought: the body of a world
Whose blunt laws make an affectation of mind,
 
The mannerism of nature caught in a glass
And there become a spirit's mannerism,
A glass aswarm with things going as far as they can.

Emily Dickinson
God gave a loaf to every bird,
But just a crumb to me;
I dare not eat it, though I starve,--
My poignant luxury
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
That made the pellet mine,--
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting.
 
It might be famine all around,
I could not miss an ear,
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
My garner shows so fair.
I wonder how the rich may feel,--
An Indiaman--an Earl?
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all.

A Dying Tiger--moaned for Drink

A Dying Tiger--moaned for Drink--
I hunted all the Sand--
I caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand--
 
His Mighty Balls--in death were thick--
But searching--I could see
A Vision on the Retina
Of Water--and of me--
 
'Twas not my blame--who sped too slow--
'Twas not his blame--who died
While I was reaching him--
But 'twas--the fact that He was dead--

First Party At Ken Kesey's With Hell's Angels

Cool black night thru redwoods
cars parked outside in shade
behind the gate, stars dim above
the ravine, a fire burning by the side
porch and a few tired souls hunched over
in black leather jackets. In the huge
wooden house, a yellow chandelier
at 3 A.M. the blast of loudspeakers
hi-fi Rolling Stones Ray Charles Beatles
Jumping Joe Jackson and twenty youths
dancing to the vibration thru the floor,
a little weed in the bathroom, girls in scarlet
tights, one muscular smooth skinned man
sweating dancing for hours, beer cans
bent littering the yard, a hanged man
sculpture dangling from a high creek branch,
children sleeping softly in their bedroom bunks.
And 4 police cars parked outside the painted
gate, red lights revolving in the leaves.

The Goose-Girl

Spring rides no horses down the hill,
But comes on foot, a goose-girl still.
And all the loveliest things there be
Come simply, so, it seems to me.
If ever I said, in grief or pride,
I tired of honest things, I lied:
And should be cursed forevermore
With Love in laces, like a whore,
And neighbours cold, and friends unsteady,
And Spring on horseback, like a lady!

How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine

How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine—
I knew last night—when someone tried to twine—
Thinking—perhaps—that I looked tired—or alone—
Or breaking—almost—with unspoken pain—
 
And I turned—ducal—
That right—was thine—
One port—suffices—for a Brig—like mine—

Rather than a Mooring—unshared by thee.
Ours be the Cargo—unladed—here—
Rather than the ""spicy isles—""

Kraj Majales (King of May)
Allen Ginsberg
And the Communists have nothing to offer but fat cheeks and eyeglasses and
lying policemen
and the Capitalists proffer Napalm and money in green suitcases to the
Naked,
and the Communists create heavy industry but the heart is also heavy
and the beautiful engineers are all dead, the secret technicians conspire for
their own glamour
in the Future, in the Future, but now drink vodka and lament the Security
Forces,
and the Capitalists drink gin and whiskey on airplanes but let Indian brown
millions starve
and when Communist and Capitalist assholes tangle the Just man is arrested
or robbed or has his head cut off,
but not like Kabir, and the cigarette cough of the Just man above the clouds
in the bright sunshine is a salute to the health of the blue sky.
For I was arrested thrice in Prague, once for singing drunk on Narodni
street,
once knocked down on the midnight pavement by a mustached agent who
screamed out BOUZERANT,
once for losing my notebooks of unusual sex politics dream opinions,
and I was sent from Havana by planes by detectives in green uniform,
and I was sent from Prague by plane by detectives in Czechoslovakian
business suits,
Cardplayers out of Cezanne, the two strange dolls that entered Joseph K's
room at morn
also entered mine and ate at my table, and examined my scribbles,
and followed me night and morn from the houses of the lovers to the cafes of
Centrum -
And I am the King of May, which is the power of sexual youth,
and I am the King of May, which is long hair of Adam and Beard of my
own body
and I am the King of May, which is Kraj Majales in the Czechoslovakian
tongue,
and I am the King of May, which is old Human poesy, and 100,000 people
chose my name,
and I am the King of May, and in a few minutes I will land at London
Airport,
and I am the King of May, naturally, for I am of Slavic parentage and a
Buddhist Jew
who whorships the Sacred Heart of Christ the blue body of Krishna the
straight back of Ram
the beads of Chango the Nigerian singing Shiva Shiva in a manner which
I have invented,
and the King of May is a middleeuropean honor, mine in the XX century
despite space ships and the Time Machine, because I have heard the voice of Blake
in a vision
and repeat that voice. And I am the King of May that sleeps with teenagers
laughing.
And I am the King of May, that I may be expelled from my Kingdom with
Honor, as of old,
To show the difference between Caesar's Kingdom and the Kingdom of the
May of Man -

and I am the King of May because I touched my finger to my forehead
saluting
a luminous heavy girl trembling hands who said ""one moment Mr. Ginsberg""
before a fat young Plainclothesman stepped between our bodies - I was
going to England -
and I am the King of May, in a giant jetplane touching Albion's airfield
trembling in fear
as the plane roars to a landing on the gray concrete, shakes & expels air,
and rolls slowly to a stop under the clouds with part of blue heaven still
visible.
And tho' I am the King of May, the Marxists have beat me upon the street,
kept me up all night in Police Station, followed me thru Springtime
Prague, detained me in secret and deported me from our kingdom by
airplane.
This I have written this poem on a jet seat in mid Heaven.

Journey
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Ah, could I lay me down in this long grass
And close my eyes, and let the quiet wind
Blow over me -- I am so tired, so tired
Of passing pleasant places! All my life,
Following Care along the dusty road,
Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed;
Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand
Tugged ever, and I passed. All my life long
Over my shoulder have I looked at peace;
And now I fain would lie in this long grass
And close my eyes.
Yet onward!
Cat birds call
Through the long afternoon, and creeks at dusk
Are guttural. Whip-poor-wills wake and cry,
Drawing the twilight close about their throats.
Only my heart makes answer. Eager vines
Go up the rocks and wait; flushed apple-trees
Pause in their dance and break the ring for me;
And bayberry, that through sweet bevies thread
Of round-faced roses, pink and petulant,
Look back and beckon ere they disappear.
Only my heart, only my heart responds.
Yet, ah, my path is sweet on either side
All through the dragging day, -- sharp underfoot
And hot, and like dead mist the dry dust hangs -- 
But far, oh, far as passionate eye can reach,
And long, ah, long as rapturous eye can cling,
The world is mine: blue hill, still silver lake,
Broad field, bright flower, and the long white road
A gateless garden, and an open path:
My feet to follow, and my heart to hold.

And it will ache--contented--on--
Sing--at its pain--as any Workman--

Wild Orphan
Allen Ginsberg
Blandly mother
takes him strolling
by railroad and by river
-he's the son of the absconded
hot rod angel-
and he imagines cars
and rides them in his dreams,
 
so lonely growing up among
the imaginary automobiles
and dead souls of Tarrytown
 
to create
out of his own imagination
the beauty of his wild
forebears-a mythology
he cannot inherit.
 
Will he later hallucinate
his gods? Waking
among mysteries with
an insane gleam
of recollection?
 
The recognition-
something so rare
in his soul,
met only in dreams
-nostalgias
of another life.
 
A question of the soul.
And the injured
losing their injury
in their innocence
-a cock, a cross,
an excellence of love.
 
And the father grieves
in flophouse
complexities of memory
a thousand miles
away, unknowing
of the unexpected
youthful stranger
bumming toward his door.

For Johnny Pole On The Forgotten Beach
Anne Sexton
In his tenth July some instinct
taught him to arm the waiting wave,
a giant where its mouth hung open.
He rode on the lip that buoyed him there
and buckled him under. The beach was strung
with children paddling their ages in,
under the glare od noon chipping
its light out. He stood up, anonymous
and straight among them, between
their sand pails and nursery crafts.
The breakers cartwheeled in and over
to puddle their toes and test their perfect
skin. He was my brother, my small
Johnny brother, almost ten. We flopped
down upon a towel to grind the sand
under us and watched the Atlantic sea
move fire, like night sparklers;
and lost our weight in the festival
season. He dreamed, he said, to be
a man designed like a balanced wave...
how someday he would wait, giant
and straight.
Johnny, your dream moves summers
inside my mind.
He was tall and twenty that July,
but there was no balance to help;
only the shells came straight and even.
This was the first beach of assault;
the odor of death hung in the air
like rotting potatoes, the junkyard
of landing craft waited open and rusting.
The bodies were strung out as if they were
still reaching for each other, where they lay
to blacken, to burst through their perfect
skin. And Johnny Pole was one of them.
He gave in like a small wave, a sudden
hole in his belly and the years all gone
where the Pacific noon chipped its light out.
Like a bean bag, outflung, head loose
and anonymous, he lay. Did the sea move fire
for its battle season? Does he lie there
forever, where his rifle waits, giant
and straight?...I think you die again
and live again,
Johnny, each summer that moves inside
my mind.

Menses
Edna St. Vincent Millay
(He speaks, but to himself, being aware how it is with her)
Think not I have not heard.
Well-fanged the double word
And well-directed flew.
 
I felt it. Down my side
Innocent as oil I see the ugly venom slide:
Poison enough to stiffen us both, and all our friends;
But I am not pierced, so there the mischief ends.
 
There is more to be said: I see it coiling;
The impact will be pain.
Yet coil; yet strike again.
You cannot riddle the stout mail I wove
Long since, of wit and love.
 
As for my answer . . . stupid in the sun
He lies, his fangs drawn:
I will not war with you.
 
You know how wild you are. You are willing to be turned
To other matters; you would be grateful, even.
You watch me shyly. I (for I have learned
More things than one in our few years together)
Chafe at the churlish wind, the unseasonable weather.
 
""Unseasonable?"" you cry, with harsher scorn
Than the theme warrants; ""Every year it is the same!
'Unseasonable!' they whine, these stupid peasants! -- and never
since they were born
Have they known a spring less wintry! Lord, the shame,
The crying shame of seeing a man no wiser than the beasts he
feeds -- 
His skull as empty as a shell!""
 
(""Go to. You are unwell."")
 
Such is my thought, but such are not my words.
 
""What is the name,"" I ask, ""of those big birds
With yellow breast and low and heavy flight,
That make such mournful whistling?""
 
""Meadowlarks,""
You answer primly, not a little cheered.
""Some people shoot them."" Suddenly your eyes are wet
And your chin trembles. On my breast you lean,
And sob most pitifullly for all the lovely things that are not and
have been.
 
""How silly I am! -- and I know how silly I am!""
You say; ""You are very patient. You are very kind.

I shall be better soon. Just Heaven consign and damn
To tedious Hell this body with its muddy feet in my mind!""

The Interrogation Of The Man Of Many Hearts
Anne Sexton
Who's she, that one in your arms?
 
She's the one I carried my bones to
and built a house that was just a cot
and built a life that was over an hour
and built a castle where no one lives
and built, in the end, a song
to go with the ceremony.
 
Why have you brought her here?
Why do you knock on my door
with your little stores and songs?
 
I had joined her the way a man joins
a woman and yet there was no place
for festivities or formalities
and these things matter to a woman
and, you see, we live in a cold climate
and are not permitted to kiss on the street
so I made up a song that wasn't true.
I made up a song called Marriage.
 
You come to me out of wedlock
and kick your foot on my stoop
and ask me to measure such things?
 
Never. Never. Not my real wife.
She's my real witch, my fork, my mare,
my mother of tears, my skirtful of hell,
the stamp of my sorrows, the stamp of my bruises
and also the children she might bear
and also a private place, a body of bones
that I would honestly buy, if I could buy,
that I would marry, if I could marry.
 
And should I torment you for that?
Each man has a small fate allotted to him
and yours is a passionate one.
 
But I am in torment. We have no place.
The cot we share is almost a prison
where I can't say buttercup, bobolink,
sugarduck, pumpkin, love ribbon, locket,
valentine, summergirl, funnygirl and all
those nonsense things one says in bed.
To say I have bedded with her is not enough.
I have not only bedded her down.
I have tied her down with a knot.
 
Then why do you stick your fists
into your pockets? Why do you shuffle
your feet like a schoolboy?

For years I have tied this knot in my dreams.
I have walked through a door in my dreams
and she was standing there in my mother's apron.
Once she crawled through a window that was shaped
like a keyhole and she was wearing my daughter's
pink corduroys and each time I tied these women
in a knot. Once a queen came. I tied her too.
But this is something I have actually tied
and now I have made her fast.
I sang her out. I caught her down.
I stamped her out with a song.
There was no other apartment for it.
There was no other chamber for it.
Only the knot. The bedded-down knot.
Thus I have laid my hands upon her
and have called her eyes and her mouth
as mine, as also her tongue.
 
Why do you ask me to make choices?
I am not a judge or a psychologist.
You own your bedded-down knot.
 
And yet I have real daytimes and nighttimes
with children and balconies and a good wife.
Thus I have tied these other knots,
yet I would rather not think of them
when I speak to you of her. Not now.
If she were a room to rent I would pay.
If she were a life to save I would save.
Maybe I am a man of many hearts.
 
A man of many hearts?
Why then do you tremble at my doorway?
A man of many hearts does not need me.
 
I'm caught deep in the dye of her.
I have allowed you to catch me red-handed,
catch me with my wild oats in a wild clock
for my mare, my dove and my own clean body.
People might say I have snakes in my boots
but I tell you that just once am I in the stirrups,
just once, this once, in the cup.
The love of the woman is in the song.
I called her the woman in red.
I called her the woman in pink
but she was ten colors
and ten women
I could hardly name her.
 
I know who she is.
You have named her enough.

Maybe I shouldn't have put it in words.
Frankly, I think I'm worse for this kissing,
drunk as a piper, kicking the traces
and determined to tie her up forever.
You see the song is the life,
the life I can't live.
God, even as he passes,
hand down monogamy like slang.
I wanted to write her into the law.
But, you know, there is no law for this.
 
Man of many hearts, you are a fool!
The clover has grown thorns this year
and robbed the cattle of their fruit
and the stones of the river
have sucked men's eyes dry,
season after season,
and every bed has been condemned,
not by morality or law,
but by time.

Ballad of the Goodly Fere
Ezra Pound
Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all
For the priests and the gallows tree?
Aye lover he was of brawny men,
O' ships and the open sea.
 
When they came wi' a host to take Our Man
His smile was good to see,
""First let these go!"" quo' our Goodly Fere,
""Or I'll see ye damned,"" says he.
 
Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears
And the scorn of his laugh rang free,
""Why took ye not me when I walked about
Alone in the town?"" says he.
 
Oh we drank his ""Hale"" in the good red wine
When we last made company,
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere
But a man o' men was he.
 
I ha' seen him drive a hundred men
Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free,
That they took the high and holy house
For their pawn and treasury.
 
They'll no' get him a' in a book I think
Though they write it cunningly;
No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere
But aye loved the open sea.
 
If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere
They are fools to the last degree.
""I'll go to the feast,"" quo' our Goodly Fere,
""Though I go to the gallows tree.""
 
""Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind,
And wake the dead,"" says he,
""Ye shall see one thing to master all:
'Tis how a brave man dies on the tree.""
 
A son of God was the Goodly Fere
That bade us his brothers be.
I ha' seen him cow a thousand men.
I have seen him upon the tree.
 
He cried no cry when they drave the nails
And the blood gushed hot and free,
The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue
But never a cry cried he.
 
I ha' seen him cow a thousand men
On the hills o' Galilee,

They whined as he walked out calm between,
Wi' his eyes like the grey o' the sea,
 
Like the sea that brooks no voyaging
With the winds unleashed and free,
Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret
Wi' twey words spoke' suddently.
 
A master of men was the Goodly Fere,
A mate of the wind and sea,
If they think they ha' slain our Goodly Fere
They are fools eternally.
 
I ha' seen him eat o' the honey-comb
Sin' they nailed him to the tree.

Wanting to Die
Anne Sexton
Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.
 
Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.
 
But suicides have a special language.
Like carpenters they want to know which tools.
They never ask why build.
 
Twice I have so simply declared myself,
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,
have taken on his craft, his magic.
 
In this way, heavy and thoughtful,
warmer than oil or water,
I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.
 
I did not think of my body at needle point.
Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.
Suicides have already betrayed the body.
 
Still-born, they don't always die,
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet
that even children would look on and smile.
 
To thrust all that life under your tongue!--
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.
Death's a sad Bone; bruised, you'd say,
 
and yet she waits for me, year after year,
to so delicately undo an old wound,
to empty my breath from its bad prison.
 
Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,
raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon,
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,
 
leaving the page of the book carelessly open,
something unsaid, the phone off the hook
and the love, whatever it was, an infection.

Up in the hills they started taking bribes
Then they sent their soldiers up to Shan
Collecting opium to send to The Man
 
Pushing junk in Bangkok yesterday
Supported by the CIA
 
Brought their jam on mule trains down
To Chiang Mai that's a railroad town
Sold it next to the police chief's brain
He took it to town on the choochoo train
Trafficking dope to Bangkok all day
Supported by the CIA
 
The policeman's name was Mr. Phao
He peddled dope grand scale and how
Chief of border customs paid
By Central Intelligence's U.S. aid
 
The whole operation, Newspapers say
Supported by the CIA
 
He got so sloppy and peddled so loose
He busted himself and cooked his own goose
Took the reward for the opium load
Seizing his own haul which same he resold
 
Big time pusher for a decade turned grey
Working for the CIA
 
Touby Lyfong he worked for the French
A big fat man liked to dine & wench
Prince of the Meos he grew black mud
Till opium flowed through the land like a flood
 
Communists came and chased the French away
So Touby took a job with the CIA
 
The whole operation fell in to chaos
Till U.S. intelligence came in to Laos
 
Mary Azarian/Matt Wuerker I'll tell you no lie I'm a true American

Our big pusher there was Phoumi Nosavan
 
All them Princes in a power play
But Phoumi was the man for the CIA
 
And his best friend General Vang Pao
Ran the Meo army like a sacred cow
Helicopter smugglers filled Long Cheng's bars
In Xieng Quang province on the Plain of Jars
 
It started in secret they were fighting yesterday
Clandestine secret army of the CIA
 
All through the Sixties the dope flew free
Thru Tan Son Nhut Saigon to Marshall Ky
Air America followed through
Transporting comfiture for President Thieu
 
All these Dealers were decades and yesterday
The Indochinese mob of the U.S. CIA
 
Operation Haylift Offisir Wm Colby
Saw Marshall Ky fly opium Mr. Mustard told me
Indochina desk he was Chief of Dirty Tricks
""Hitch-hiking"" with dope pushers was how he got his fix
 
Subsidizing the traffickers to drive the Reds away
Till Colby was the head of the CIA

I Dream'd In A Dream
Walt Whitman
I DREAM'D in a dream, I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the
whole of the rest of the earth;
I dream'd that was the new City of Friends;
Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love--it led the
rest;
It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,
And in all their looks and words.

Being Young and Green, I said in love's despite:
Never in the world will I to living wight

To be shredded and faded -- 
 
Oh, me, invaded
And sacked by the wind and the sun!

Sylvia Plath
Pure? What does it mean?
The tongues of hell
Are dull, dull as the triple
 
Tongues of dull, fat Cerebus
Who wheezes at the gate. Incapable
Of licking clean
 
The aguey tendon, the sin, the sin.
The tinder cries.
The indelible smell
 
Of a snuffed candle!
Love, love, the low smokes roll
From me like Isadora's scarves, I'm in a fright
 
One scarf will catch and anchor in the wheel.
Such yellow sullen smokes
Make their own element. They will not rise,
 
But trundle round the globe
Choking the aged and the meek,
The weak
 
Hothouse baby in its crib,
The ghastly orchid
Hanging its hanging garden in the air,
 
Devilish leopard!
Radiation turned it white
And killed it in an hour.
 
Greasing the bodies of adulterers
Like Hiroshima ash and eating in.
The sin. The sin.
 
Darling, all night
I have been flickering, off, on, off, on.
The sheets grow heavy as a lecher's kiss.
 
Three days. Three nights.
Lemon water, chicken
Water, water make me retch.
 
I am too pure for you or anyone.
Your body
Hurts me as the world hurts God. I am a lantern ----
 
My head a moon
Of Japanese paper, my gold beaten skin
Infinitely delicate and infinitely expensive.

Does not my heat astound you. And my light.
All by myself I am a huge camellia
Glowing and coming and going, flush on flush.
 
I think I am going up,
I think I may rise ----
The beads of hot metal fly, and I, love, I
 
Am a pure acetylene
Virgin
Attended by roses,
 
By kisses, by cherubim,
By whatever these pink things mean.
Not you, nor him.
 
Not him, nor him
(My selves dissolving, old whore petticoats) ----
To Paradise.

Come, let us pity those who are better off than we are.
Come, my friend, and remember

And we have friends and no butlers.
Come, let us pity the married and the unmarried.

Baffled for just a day or two
Emily Dickinson

 
Baffled for just a day or two--
Embarrassed--not afraid--
Encounter in my garden
An unexpected Maid.
 
She beckons, and the woods start--
She nods, and all begin--
Surely, such a country
I was never in!

Two Look at Two
Robert Frost
Love and forgetting might have carried them
A little further up the mountain side
With night so near, but not much further up.
They must have halted soon in any case
With thoughts of a path back, how rough it was
With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness;
When they were halted by a tumbled wall
With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this,
Spending what onward impulse they still had
In One last look the way they must not go,
On up the failing path, where, if a stone
Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself;
No footstep moved it. 'This is all,' they sighed,
Good-night to woods.' But not so; there was more.
A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
Across the wall, as near the wall as they.
She saw them in their field, they her in hers.
The difficulty of seeing what stood still,
Like some up-ended boulder split in two,
Was in her clouded eyes; they saw no fear there.
She seemed to think that two thus they were safe.
Then, as if they were something that, though strange,
She could not trouble her mind with too long,
She sighed and passed unscared along the wall.
'This, then, is all. What more is there to ask?'
But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait.
A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
Across the wall as near the wall as they.
This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,
Not the same doe come back into her place.
He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,
As if to ask, 'Why don't you make some motion?
Or give some sign of life? Because you can't.
I doubt if you're as living as you look.""
Thus till he had them almost feeling dared
To stretch a proffering hand -- and a spell-breaking.
Then he too passed unscared along the wall.
Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from.
'This must be all.' It was all. Still they stood,
A great wave from it going over them,
As if the earth in one unlooked-for favour
Had made them certain earth returned their love.

The Triumph of Wit Over Suffering
 
Head alone shows you in the prodigious act
Of digesting what centuries alone digest:
The mammoth, lumbering statuary of sorrow,
Indissoluble enough to riddle the guts
Of a whale with holes and holes, and bleed him white
Into salt seas. Hercules had a simple time,
Rinsing those stables: a baby's tears would do it.
But who'd volunteer to gulp the Laocoon,
The Dying Gaul and those innumerable pietas
Festering on the dim walls of Europe's chapels,
Museums and sepulchers? You.
You
Who borrowed feathers for your feet, not lead,
Not nails, and a mirror to keep the snaky head
In safe perspective, could outface the gorgon-grimace
Of human agony: a look to numb
Limbs: not a basilisk-blink, nor a double whammy,
But all the accumulated last grunts, groans,
Cries and heroic couplets concluding the million
Enacted tragedies on these blood-soaked boards,
And every private twinge a hissing asp
To petrify your eyes, and every village
Catastrophe a writhing length of cobra,
And the decline of empires the thick coil of a vast
Anacnoda.
Imagine: the world
Fisted to a foetus head, ravined, seamed
With suffering from conception upwards, and there
You have it in hand. Grit in the eye or a sore
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the whole globe
Expressive of grief turns gods, like kings, to rocks.
Those rocks, cleft and worn, themselves then grow
Ponderous and extend despair on earth's
Dark face.
So might rigor mortis come to stiffen
All creation, were it not for a bigger belly
Still than swallows joy.
You enter now,
Armed with feathers to tickle as well as fly,
And a fun-house mirror that turns the tragic muse
To the beheaded head of a sullen doll, one braid,
A bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the absurd mouth
Hangs in its lugubious pout. Where are
The classic limbs of stubborn Antigone?
The red, royal robes of Phedre? The tear-dazzled
Sorrows of Malfi's gentle duchess?
Gone
In the deep convulsion gripping your face, muscles
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the cosmic
Laugh does away with the unstitching, plaguey wounds

Of an eternal sufferer.
To you
Perseus, the palm, and may you poise
And repoise until time stop, the celestial balance
Which weighs our madness with our sanity.

To introduce his soul.

To an untraversed spot—
Could contemplate the journey

Such trust had one among us,
Among us not today—
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay!

moved and reachd the Ride Where gaily flows the human tide Afar in rest the cattle lay We heard afar faint music play But agitated brisk and near Men with their stream of life were here Some hang upon the rails and some On foot behind them go and come This through the Ride upon his steed Goes slowly by and this at speed The young the happy and the fair The old the sad the worn were there Some vacant and some musing went And some in talk and merriment Nods smiles and greetings and farewells And now and then perhaps there swells A sigh a tearbut in the throng All changes fast and hies along Hies ah from whence what native ground And to what goal what ending bound Behold at last the poets sphere But who I said suffices here For ah so much he has to do Be painter and musician too  The aspect of the moment show The feeling of the moment know The aspect not I grant express Clear as the painters art can dress The feeling not I grant explore So deep as the musicians lore But clear as words can make revealing And deep as words can follow feeling But ah then comes his sorest spell Of toilhe must lifes movement tell The thread which binds it all in one And not its separate parts alone The movement he must tell of life Its pain and pleasure rest and strife His eye must travel down at full The long unpausing spectacle With faithful unrelaxing force Attend it from its primal source From change to change and year to year Attend it of its mid career Attend it to the last repose And solemn silence of its close The cattle rising from the grass His thought must follow where they pass The penitent with anguish bowd His thought must follow through the crowd Yes all this eddying motley throng That sparkles in the sun along Girl statesman merchant soldier bold Master and servant young and old Grave gay child parent husband wife He follows home and lives their life And many many are the souls Lifes movement fascinates controls It draws them on they cannot save Their feet from its alluring wave They cannot leave it they must go With its unconquerable flow But ah how few of all that try This mighty march do aught but die For illendowd for such a way Illstored in strength in wits are they They faint they stagger to and fro And wandering from the stream they go In pain in terror in distress They see all round a wilderness Sometimes a momentary gleam They catch of the mysterious stream Sometimes a seconds space their ear The murmur of its waves doth hear That transient glimpse in song they say But not of painter can pourtray That transient sound in song they tell But not as the musician well And when at last their snatches cease And they are silent and at peace The stream of lifes majestic whole Hath neer been mirrord on their soul Only a few the lifestreams shore With safe unwandering feet explore Untired its movement bright attend Follow its windings to the end Then from its brimming waves their eye Drinks up delighted ecstasy And its deeptoned melodious voice For ever makes their ear rejoice They speak the happiness divine They feel runs oer in every line Its spell is round them like a shower It gives them pathos gives them power No painter yet hath such a way Nor no musician made as they And gatherd on immortal knolls Such lovely flowers for cheering souls Beethoven Raphael cannot reach The charm which Homer Shakespeare teach To these to these their thankful race Gives then the first the fairest place And brightest is their glorys sheen For greatest hath their labour been ,b,Fear

dread voice from lips that cannot lie Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny  I will unfold my sentence and my crime My crimethat rapt in reverential awe I sate obedient in the fiery prime Of youth selfgovernd at the feet of Law Ennobling this dull pomp the life of kings By contemplation of diviner things  My father loved injustice and lived long Crownd with grey hairs he died and full of sway I loved the good he scornd and hated wrong The Gods declare my recompense today I lookd for life more lasting rule more high And when six years are measured lo I die  Yet surely O my people did I deem Mans justice from the alljust Gods was given A light that from some upper fount did beam Some better archetype whose seat was heaven A light that shining from the blest abodes Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods  Mere phantoms of mans selftormenting heart Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed Vain dreams which quench our pleasures then depart When the duped soul selfmasterd claims its meed When on the strenuous just man Heaven bestows Crown of his struggling life an unjust close  Seems it so light a thing then austere Powers To spurn mans common lure lifes pleasant things Seems

wanderd on From palmgrove on to palmgrove happy trees Their smooth tops shining sunward and beneath Burying their unsunnd stems in grass and flowers Where in one dream the feverish time of youth Might fade in slumber and the feet of joy Might wander all day long and never tire Here came the king holding high feast at morn Rosecrownd and ever when the sun went down A hundred lamps beamd in the tranquil gloom From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove Revealing all the tumult of the feast Flushd guests and golden goblets foamd with wine While the deepburnishd foliage overhead Splinterd the silver arrows of the moon   It may be that sometimes his wondering soul From the loud joyful laughter of his lips Might shrink half startled like a guilty man Who wrestles with his dream as some pale shape Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl Whispering A little space and thou art mine It may be on that joyless feast his eye Dwelt with mere outward seeming he within Took measure of his soul and knew its strength And by that silent knowledge day by day Was calmd ennobled comforted sustaind It may be but not less his brow was smooth And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom And his mirth quaild not at the mild reproof Sighd out by winters sad tranquillity Nor palld with its own fulness ebbd and died In the rich languor of long summerdays Nor witherd when the palmtree plumes that roofd With their mild dark his grassy banquethall Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring No nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds   So six long years he revelld night and day And when the mirth waxd loudest with dull sound Sometimes from the groves centre echoes came To tell his wondering people of their king In the still

thought again  So well she mused a morning broke Across her spirit grey A conquering newborn joy awoke And filld her life with day  Poor world she cried so deep accurst That runnst from pole to pole To seek a draught to slake thy thirst Go seek it in thy soul  She heard it the victorious West In crown and sword arrayd She felt the void which mined her breast She shiverd and obeyd  She veild her eagles snappd her sword And laid her sceptre down Her stately purple she abhorrd And her imperial crown  She broke her flutes she stoppd her sports Her artists could not please She tore her books she shut her courts She fled her palaces  Lust of the eye and pride of life She left it all behind And hurried torn with inward strife The wilderness to find  Tears washd the trouble from her face She changed into a child Mid weeds and wrecks she stooda place Of ruinbut she smiled  Oh had I lived in that great day How had its glory new Filld earth and heaven and caught away My ravishd spirit too  No thoughts that to the world belong Had stood against the wave Of love which set so deep and strong From Christs then open grave  No cloisterfloor of humid stone Had been too cold for me For me no Eastern desert lone Had been too far to flee  No lonely life had passd too slow When I could hourly scan Upon his Cross with head sunk low That naild thorncrowned Man  Could see the Mother with her Child Whose tender winning arts Have to his little arms beguiled So many wounded hearts  And centuries came and ran their course And unspent all that time Still still went forth that Childs dear force And still was at its prime  Ay ages long endured his span Of lifetis true received That gracious Child that thorncrownd Man He lived while we believed  While we believed on earth he went And open stood his grave Men calld from chamber church and tent And Christ was by to save  Now he is dead Far hence he lies In the lorn Syrian town And on his grave with shining eyes The Syrian stars look down  In vain men still with hoping new Regard his deathplace dumb And say the stone is not yet to And wait for words to come  Ah oer that silent sacred land Of sun and arid stone And crumbling wall and sultry sand Sounds now one word alone  Unduped of fancy henceforth man Must labourmust resign His all too human creeds and scan Simply the way divine  But slow that tide of common thought Which bathed our life retired Slow slow the old world wore to nought And pulse by pulse expired  Its frame yet stood without a breach When blood and warmth were fled And still it spake its wonted speech But every word was dead  And oh we cried that on this corse Might fall a freshening storm Rive its dry bones and with new force A newsprung world inform  Down came the storm Oer France it passd In sheets of scathing fire All Europe felt that fiery blast And shook as it rushd by her  Down came the storm In ruins fell The wornout world we knew It passd that elemental swell Again appeard the blue  The sun shone in the newwashd sky And what from heaven saw he Blocks of the past like icebergs high Float on a rolling sea  Upon them plies the race of man All it before endeavourd Ye live I cried ye work and plan And know not ye are severd  Poor fragments of a broken world Whereon men pitch their tent Why were ye too to death not hurld When your worlds day was spent  That glow of central fire is done Which with its fusing flame Knit all your parts and kept you one But ye ye are the same  The past its mask of union on Had ceased to live and thrive The past its mask of union gone Say is it more alive  Your creeds are dead your rites are dead Your social order too Where tarries he the Power who said See I make all things new  The millions suffer still and grieve And what can helpers heal With oldworld cures men half believe For woes they wholly feel  And yet men have such need of joy But joy whose grounds are true And joy that should all hearts employ As when the past was new  Ah not the emotion of that past Its common hope were vain Some new such hope must dawn at last Or man must toss in pain  But now the old is out of date The new is not yet born And who can be alone elate While the world lies forlorn  Then to the wilderness I fled There among Alpine snows And pastoral huts I hid my head And sought and found repose  It was not yet the appointed hour Sad patient and resignd I watchd the crocus fade and flower I felt the sun and wind  The day I lived in was not mine Man gets no second day In dreams I saw the future shine But ah I could not stay  Action I had not followers fame I passd obscure alone The afterworld forgets my name Nor do I wish it known  Composed to bear I lived and died And knew my life was vain With fate I murmur not nor chide At Svres by the Seine  If Paris that brief flight allow My humble tomb explore It bears Eternity be thou My refuge and no more  But thou whom fellowship of mood Did make from haunts of strife Come to my mountainsolitude And learn my frustrate life  O thou who ere thy flying span Was past of cheerful youth Didst find the solitary man And love his cheerless truth  Despair not thou as I despaird Nor be cold gloom thy prison

Divinelier imaged clearer seen With happier zeal pursued  With hope extinct and brow composed I markd the present die Its term of life was nearly closed Yet it had more than I  But thou though to the worlds new hour Thou come with aspect marrd Shorn of the joy the bloom the power Which best befits its bard  Though more than half thy years be past And spent thy youthful prime Though round thy firmer manhood cast Hang weeds of our sad time  Whereof thy youth felt all the spell And traversed all the shade Though late though dimmd though weak yet tell Hope to a world newmade  Help it to fill that deep desire The want which rackd our brain Consumed our heart with thirst like fire Immedicable pain  Which to the wilderness drove out Our life to Alpine snow And palsied all our word with doubt And all our work with woe  What still of strength is left employ That end to help attain One common wave of thought and joy Lifting mankind again  The vision ended I awoke As out of sleep and no Voice movedonly the torrent broke The silence far below  Soft darkness on the turf did lie Solemn oer hut and wood In the yet starsown nightly sky The peak of Jaman stood  Still in my soul the voice I heard Of Obermannaway I turnd by some vague impulse stirrd Along the rocks of Naye  Past Sonchauds piny flanks I gaze And the blanchd summit bare Of Malatrait to where in haze The Valais opens fair  And the domed Velan with his snows Behind the upcrowding hills Doth all the heavenly opening close Which the Rhones murmur fills  And glorious there without a sound Across the glimmering lake High in the

1622,Sohrab And Rustum And the first grey of morning filld the east And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream But all the Tartar camp along the stream Was hushd and still the men were plunged in sleep Sohrab alone he slept not all night long He had lain wakeful tossing on his bed But when the grey dawn stole into his tent He rose and clad himself and girt his sword And took his horsemans cloak and left his tent And went abroad into the cold wet fog Through the dim camp to PeranWisas tent Through the black Tartar tents he passd which stood Clustering like beehives on the low flat strand Of Oxus where the summerfloods oerflow When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere Through the black tents he passd oer that low strand And to a hillock came a little back From the streams brinkthe spot where first a boat Crossing the stream in summer scrapes the land The men of former times had crownd the top With a clay fort but that was falln and now The Tartars built there PeranWisas tent A dome of laths and oer it felts were spread And Sohrab came there and went in and stood Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent And found the old man sleeping on his bed Of rugs and felts and near him lay his arms And PeranWisa heard him though the step Was dulld for he slept light an old mans sleep And he rose quickly on one arm and said Who art thou for it is not yet clear dawn Speak is there news or any night alarm But Sohrab came to the bedside and said Thou knowst me PeranWisa it is I The sun is not yet risen and the foe Sleep but I sleep not all night long I lie Tossing and wakeful and I come to thee For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek Thy counsel and to heed thee as thy son In Samarcand before the army marchd And I will tell thee what my heart desires Thou knowst if since from Aderbaijan first I came among the Tartars and bore arms I have still served Afrasiab well and shown At my boys yearsthe courage of a man This too thou knowst that while I still bear on The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world And beat the Persiansback on every field I seek one manone man and one alone Rustum my father who I hoped should greetShould one day greet upon some well fought fieldHisnot unworthy not inglorious son So I long hoped but him Inever find Come then hear now and grant me what I ask Let the two armies rest today but I Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords To meet me

safe and well though lost To us fain therefore send thee hence in peace To seek thy father not seek single fights In vainbut who can keep the lions cub From ravening and who govern Rustums son Go I will grant thee what thy heart desires So said he and droppd Sohrabs hand and left His bed and the warm rugs whereon he lay And oer his chilly limbs his woollen coat He passd and tied his sandals on his feet And threw a white cloak round him and he took In his right hand a rulers staff no sword And on his head he set his sheepskin cap Black glossy curld the fleece of KaraKul And raised the curtain of his tent and calld His herald to his side and went abroad The sun by this had risen and cleard the fog From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed Into the open plain so Haman bade Haman who next to PeranWisa ruled The host and still was in his lusty prime From their black tents long files of horse they streamd As when some grey November morn the files In marching order spread of longneckd cranes Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes Of Elburz from the Aralian estuaries Or some frore Caspian reedbed southward bound For the warm Persian seaboardso they streamd The Tartars of the Oxus the Kings guard First with black sheepskin caps and with long spears Large men large steeds who from Bokhara come And Khiva and ferment the milk of mares Next the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south The Tukas and the lances of Salore And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands Light men and on light steeds who only drink The acrid milk of camels and their wells And then a swarm of wandering horse who came From far and a more doubtful service ownd The Tartars of Ferghana from the banks Of the Jaxartes men with scanty beards And closeset skullcaps and those wilder hordes Who roam oer Kipchak and the northern waste Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks tribes who stray Nearest the Pole and wandering Kirghizzes Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere These all filed out from camp into the plain And on the other side the Persians formd First a light cloud of horse Tartars they seemd The Ilyats of Khorassan and behind The royal troops of Persia horse and foot Marshalld battalions bright in burnishd steel But PeranWisa with his herald came Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks And when Ferood who led the Persians saw That PeranWisa kept the Tartars back He took his spear and to the front he came And checkd his ranks and fixd them where they stood And the old Tartar came upon the sand Betwixt the silent hosts and spake and said Ferood and ye Persians and Tartars hear Let there be truce between the hosts today But choose a champion from the Persian lords To fight our champion Sohrab man to man As in the country on a morn in June When the dew glistens on the pearled ears A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy So when they heard what PeranWisa said A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran Of pride and hope for Sohrab whom they loved But as a troop of pedlars from Cabool Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus That vast skyneighbouring mountain of milk snow Crossing so high that as they mount they pass Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow Choked by the air and scarce can they themselves Slake their parchd throats with sugard mulberries In single file they move and stop their breath For fear they should dislodge the oer hanging snows So the pale Persians held their breath with fear And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up To counsel Gudurz and Zoarrah came And Feraburz who ruled the Persian host Second and was the uncle of the King These came and counselld and then Gudurz said Ferood shame bids us take their challenge up Yet champion have we none to match this youth He has the wild stags foot the lions heart But Rustum came last night aloof he sits And sullen and has pitchd his tents apart Him will I seek and carry to his ear The Tartar challenge and this young mans name Haply he will forget his wrath and fight Stand forth the while and take their challenge up So spake he and Ferood stood forth and cried Old man be it agreed as thou hast said Let Sohrab arm and we will find a man He spake and PeranWisa turnd and strode Back through the opening squadrons to his tent But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran And crossd the camp which lay behind and reachd Out on the sands beyond it Rustums tents Of scarlet cloth they were and glittering gay Just pitchd the high pavilion in the midst Was Rustums and his men lay campd around And Gudurz enterd Rustums tent and found Rustum his morning meal was done but still The table stood before him charged with food A side of roasted sheep and cakes of bread And dark green melons and there Rustum sate Listless and held a falcon on his wrist And playd with it but Gudurz came and stood Before him and he lookd and saw him stand And with a cry sprang up and droppd the bird And greeted Gudurz with both hands and said Welcome these eyes could see no better sight What news but sit down first and eat and drink But Gudurz stood in the tentdoor and said Not now a time will come to eat and drink But not today today has other needs The armies are drawn out and stand at gaze For from the Tartars is a challenge brought To pick a champion from the Persian lords To fight their championand thou knowst his name Sohrab men call him but his birth is kid O Rustum like thy might is this young mans He has the wild stags foot the lions heart And he is young and Irans chiefs are old Or else too weak and all eyes turn to thee Come down and help us Rustum or we lose He spoke but Rustum answerd with a smile Go to if Irans chiefs are old then I Am older if the young are weak the King Errs strangely for the King for Kai Khosroo Himself is young and honours younger men And lets the aged moulder to their graves Rustum he loves no more but loves the young The young may rise at Sohrabs vaunts not I For what care I though all speak Sohrabs fame For would that I myself had such a son And not that one slight helpless girl I have A son so famed so brave to send to war And I to tarry with the snowhaird Zal My father whom the robber Afghans vex And clip his borders short and drive his herds And he has none to guard his weak old age There would I go and hang my armour up And with my great name fence that weak old man And spend the goodly treasures I have got And rest my age and hear of Sohrabs fame And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more He spoke and smiled and Gudurz made reply What then O Rustum will men say to this When Sohrab dares our bravest forth and seeks Thee most of all and thou whom most he seeks Hidest thy face Take heed lest men should say Like some old miser Rustum hoards his fame And shuns to peril it with younger men And greatly moved then Rustum made reply O Gudurz wherefore dost thou say such words Thou knowest better words than this to say What is one more one less obscure or famed Valiant or craven young or old to me Are not they mortal am not I myself But who for men of nought would do great deeds Come thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame But I will fight unknown and in plain arms Let not men say of Rustum he was matchd In single fight with any mortal man He spoke and frownd and Gudurz turnd and ran Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy Fear at his wrath but joy that Rustum came But Rustum strode to his tentdoor and calld His followers in and bade them bring his arms And clad himself in steel the arms he chose Were plain and on his shield was no device Only his helm was rich inlaid with gold And from the fluted spine atop a plume Of horsehair waved a scarlet horsehair plume So armd he issued forth and Ruksh his horse Followd him like a faithful hound at heel Ruksh whose renown was noised through all the earth The horse whom Rustum on a foray once Did in Bokhara by the river find A colt beneath its dam and drove him home And reard him a bright bay with lofty crest Dight with a saddlecloth of broiderd green Crusted with gold and on the ground were workd All beasts of chase all beasts which hunters know So followd Rustum left his tents and crossd The camp and to the Persian host appeard And all the Persians knew him and with shouts Haild but the Tartars knew not who he was And dear as the wet diver to the eyes Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore By sandy Bahrein in the Persian Gulf Plunging all day in the blue waves at night Having made up his tale of precious pearls Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came And Rustum to the Persian front advanced And Sohrab armd in Hamans tent and came And as afield the reapers cut a swath Down through the middle of a rich mans corn And on each side are squares of standing corn And in the midst a stubble short and bare So on each side were squares of men with spears Bristling and in the midst the open sand And Rustum came upon the sand and cast His eyes toward the Tartar tents and saw Sohrab come forth and eyed him as he came As some rich woman on a winters morn Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge Who with numb blackend fingers makes her fire At cockcrow on a starlit winters morn When the frost flowers the whitend windowpanes And wonders how she lives and what the thoughts Of that poor drudge may be so Rustum eyed The unknown adventurous youth who from afar Came seeking Rustum and defying forth All the most valiant chiefs long he perused His spirited air and wonderd who he was For very young he seemd tenderly reard Like some young cypress tall and dark and straight Which in a queens secluded garden throws Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf By midnight to a bubbling fountains sound So slender Sohrab seemd so softly reard And a deep pity enterd Rustums soul As he beheld him coming and he stood And beckond to him with his hand and said O thou young man the air of Heaven is soft And warm and pleasant but the grave is cold Heavens air is better than the cold dead grave Behold me I am vast and clad in iron And tried and I have stood on many a field Of blood and I have fought with many a foe Never was that field lost ,b,Fear

melancholy sciolists say Is a passd mode an outworn theme As if the world had ever had A faith or sciolists been sad Ah if it be passd take away At least the restlessness the pain Be man henceforth no more a prey To these outdated stings again The nobleness of grief is gone Ah leave us not the fret alone Butif you cannot give us ease Last of the race of them who grieve Here leave us to die out with these Last of the people who believe Silent while years engrave the brow Silentthe best are silent now Achilles ponders in his tent The kings of modern thought are dumb Silent they are though not content And wait to see the future come They have the grief men had of yore But they contend and cry no more Our fathers waterd with their tears This sea of time whereon we sail Their voices were in all mens ears We passd within their puissant hail Still the same ocean round us raves But we stand mute and watch the waves For what availd it all the noise And outcry of the former men Say have their sons achieved more joys Say is life lighter now than then The sufferers died they left their pain The pangs which tortured them remain What helps it now that Byron bore With haughty scorn which mockd the smart Through Europe to the tolian shore The pageant of his bleeding heart That thousands counted every groan And Europe made his woe her own What boots it Shelley that the breeze Carried thy lovely wail away Musical through Italian trees Which fringe thy soft blue Spezzian bay Inheritors of thy distress Have restless hearts one throb the less Or are we easier to have read O Obermann the sad stern page Which tells us how thou hiddst thy head From the fierce tempest of thine age In the lone brakes of Fontainebleau Or chalets near the Alpine snow Ye slumber in your silent grave The world which for an idle day Grace to your mood of sadness gave Long since hath flung her weeds away The eternal trifler breaks your spell But wewe learned your lore too well Years hence perhaps may dawn an age More fortunate alas than we Which without hardness will be sage And gay without frivolity Sons of the world oh speed those years But while we wait allow our tears Allow them We admire with awe The exulting thunder of your race You give the universe your law You triumph over time and space Your pride of life your tireless powers We laud them but they are not ours We are like children reard in shade Beneath some oldworld abbey wall Forgotten in a forestglade And secret from the eyes of all Deep deep the greenwood round them waves Their abbey and its close of graves But where the road runs near the stream Oft through the trees they catch a glance Of passing troops in the suns beam Pennon and plume and flashing lance Forth to the world those soldiers fare To life to cities and to war And through the wood another way Faint buglenotes from far are borne Where hunters gather staghounds bay Round some fair forestlodge at morn Gay dames are there in sylvan green Laughter and criesthose notes between The banners flashing through the trees Make their blood dance and chain their eyes That buglemusic on the breeze Arrests them with a charmd surprise Banner by turns and bugle woo Ye shy recluses follow too O children what do ye reply Action and pleasure will ye roam Through these secluded dells to cry And call usbut too late ye come Too late for us your call ye blow Whose bent was taken long ago Long since we pace this shadowd nave We watch those yellow tapers shine Emblems of hope over the grave In the high altars depth divine The organ carries to our ear Its accents of another sphere Fenced early in this cloistral round Of reverie of shade of prayer How should we grow in other ground How can we flower in foreign air Pass banners pass and bugles cease And leave our desert to its peace,b,Fear

1627,The Church Of Brou I THE CASTLE Down the Savoy valleys sounding Echoing round this castle old Mid the distant mountainchalets Hark what bell for church is tolld In the bright October morning Savoys Duke had left his bride From the castle past the drawbridge Flowd the hunters merry tide Steeds are neighing gallants glittering Gay her smiling lord to greet From her mulliond chambercasement Smiles the Duchess Marguerite From Vienna by the Danube Here she came a bride in spring Now the autumn crisps the forest Hunters gather bugles ring Hounds are pulling prickers swearing Horses fret and boarspears glance OffThey sweep the marshy forests Westward on the side of France Hark the games on foot they scatter Down the forestridings lone Furious single horsemen gallop Hark a shouta crasha groan Pale and breathless came the hunters On the turf dead lies the boar God the Duke lies stretchd beside him Senseless weltering in his gore In the dull October evening Down the leafstrewn forestroad To the castle past the drawbridge Came the hunters with their load In the hall with sconces blazing Ladies waiting round her seat Clothed in smiles beneath the dais Sate the Duchess Marguerite Hark below the gates unbarring Tramp of men and quick commands Tis my lord come back from hunting And the Duchess claps her hands Slow and tired came the hunters Stoppd in darkness in the court Ho this way ye laggard hunters To the hall What sport What sport Slow they enterd with their master In the hall they laid him down On his coat were leaves and bloodstains On his brow an angry frown Dead her princely youthful husband Lay before his youthful wife Bloody neath the flaring sconces And the sight froze all her life In Vienna by the Danube Kings hold revel gallants meet Gay of

mattress where thy Duchess lies On autumnmornings when the bugle sounds And ride across the drawbridge with thy hounds To hunt the boar in the crisp woods till eve And thou O Princess shalt no more receive Thou and thy ladies in the hall of state The jaded hunters with their bloody freight Coming benighted to the castlegate So sleep for ever sleep O marble Pair Or if ye wake let it be then when fair On the carved western front a flood of light Streams from the setting sun and colours bright Prophets transfigured Saints and Martyrs brave In the vast western window of the nave And on the pavement round the Tomb there glints A chequerwork of glowing sapphiretints And amethyst and rubythen unclose Your eyelids on the stone where ye repose And from your broiderd pillows lift your heads

courts of Heaven Or let it be on autumn nights when rain Doth rustlingly above your heads complain On the smooth leaden roof and on the walls Shedding her pensive light at intervals The moon through the clerestory windows shines And the wind washes through the mountainpines Then gazing up mid the dim pillars high The foliaged marble forest where ye lie Hush ye will say it is eternity This is the glimmering verge of Heaven and these The columns of the heavenly palaces And in the sweeping of the wind your ear The passage of the Angels wings will hear And on the lichencrusted leads above The

croppd herbage shoot another head But when the fields are still And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest And only the white sheep are sometimes seen Cross and recross the strips of moonblanchd green Come shepherd and again begin the quest Here where the reaper was at work of late In this high fields dark corner where he leaves His coat his basket and his earthen cruse And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves Then here at noon comes back his stores to use Here will I sit and wait While to my ear from uplands far away The bleating of the folded flocks is borne With distant cries of reapers in the corn All the live murmur of a summers day Screend is this nook oer the high halfreapd field And here till sundown shepherd will I be Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep And airswept lindens yield Their scent and rustle down their perfumed showers Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid And bower me from the August sun with shade And the eye travels down to Oxfords towers And near me on the grass lies Glanvils book Come let me read the oftread tale again The story of the Oxford scholar poor Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain Who tired of knocking at preferments door One summermorn forsook His friends and went to learn the gipsylore And roamd the world with that wild

way of life enquired Whereat he answerd that the gipsycrew His mates had arts to rule as they desired The workings of mens brains And they can bind them to what thoughts they will AndI he said the

Have often passd thee near Sitting upon the river bank oergrown Markd thine outlandish garb thy figure spare Thy dark vague eyes and soft abstracted air But when they came from bathing thou wast gone At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills Where at her open door the housewife darns Thou hast been seen or hanging on a gate To watch the threshers in the mossy barns Children who early range these slopes and late For cresses from the rills Have known thee eyeing all an Aprilday The springing pasture and the feeding kine And markd thee when the stars come out and shine Through the long dewy grass move slow away In autumn on the skirts of Bagley Wood Where most the gipsies by the turfedged way Pitch their smoked tents and every bush you see With scarlet patches taggd and shreds of grey Above the forestground called Thessaly The blackbird picking food Sees thee nor stops his meal nor fears at all So often has he known thee past him stray Rapt twirling in thy hand a witherd spray And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall And once in winter on the causeway chill Where home through flooded fields foottravellers go Have I not passd thee on the wooden bridge Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow Thy face towrd Hinksey and its wintry ridge And thou has climbd the hill And gaind the white brow of the Cumner range Turnd once to watch while thick the snowflakes fall The line of festal light in ChristChurch hall Then sought thy straw in some sequesterd grange But whatI dream Two hundred years are flown Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe That thou wert wanderd from the studious walls To learn strange arts and join a gipsytribe And thou from earth art gone Long since and in some quiet churchyard laid Some countrynook where oer thy unknown grave Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave Under a dark redfruited yewtrees shade No no thou hast not felt the lapse of hours For what wears out the life of mortal men Tis that from change to change their being rolls Tis that repeated shocks again again Exhaust the energy of strongest souls And numb the elastic powers Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit To the justpausing Genius we remit Our wornout life and arewhat we have been Thou hast not lived why shouldst thou perish so Thou hadst one aim one business one desire Else wert thou long since numberd with the dead Else hadst thou spent like other men thy fire The generations of thy peers are fled And we ourselves shall go But thou possessest an immortal lot And we imagine thee exempt from age And living as thou livst on Glanvils page Because thou hadstwhat we alas have not For early didst thou leave the world with powers Fresh undiverted to the world without Firm to their mark not spent on other things Free from the sick fatigue the languid doubt Which much to have tried in much been baffled brings O life unlike to ours Who fluctuate idly without term or scope Of whom each strives nor knows for what he strives And each half lives a hundred different lives Who wait like thee but not like thee in hope Thou waitest for the spark from heaven and we Light halfbelievers of our casual creeds Who never deeply felt nor clearly willd Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds Whose vague resolves never have been fulfilld For whom each year we see Breeds new beginnings disappointments new Who hesitate and falter life away And lose tomorrow the ground won today Ah do not we wanderer await it too Yes we await itbut it still delays And then we suffer and amongst us one Who most has sufferd takes dejectedly His seat upon the intellectual throne And all his store of sad experience he Lays bare of wretched days Tells us his miserys birth and growth and signs And how the dying spark of hope was fed And how the breast was soothed and how the head And all his hourly varied anodynes This for our wisest and we others pine And wish the long unhappy dream would end And waive all claim to bliss and try to bear With closelippd patience for our only friend Sad patience too near neighbour to despair But none has hope like thine Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray Roaming the countryside a truant boy Nursing thy project in unclouded joy And every doubt long blown by time away O born in days when wits were fresh and clear And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames Before this strange disease of modern life With its sick hurry its divided aims Its heads oertaxd its palsied hearts was rife Fly hence our contact fear Still fly plunge deeper in the bowering wood Averse as Dido did with gesture stern From her false friends approach in Hades turn Wave us away and keep thy solitude Still nursing the unconquerable hope Still clutching the inviolable shade With a free onward impulse brushing through By night the silverd branches of the glade Far on the forestskirts where none pursue On some mild pastoral slope Emerge and resting on the moonlit pales Freshen thy flowers as in former years With dew or listen with enchanted ears From the dark dingles to the nightingales But fly our paths our feverish contact fly For strong the infection of our mental strife Which though it gives no bliss yet spoils for rest And we should win thee from thy own fair life Like us distracted and like us unblest Soon soon thy cheer would die Thy hopes grow timorous and unfixd thy powers And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made And then thy glad perennial youth would fade Fade and grow old at last and die like ours Then fly our greetings fly our speech and smiles As some grave Tyrian trader from the sea Descried at sunrise an emerging prow Lifting the coolhaird creepers stealthily The fringes of a southwardfacing brow Among the gan Isles And saw the merry Grecian coaster come Freighted with amber grapes and Chian wine Green bursting figs and tunnies steepd in brine And knew the intruders on his ancient home The young lighthearted masters of the waves And snatchd his rudder and shook out more sail And day and night held on indignantly Oer the blue Midland waters with the gale Betwixt

as well Yes thou art gone and round me too the night     In evernearing circle weaves her shade        I see her veil draw soft across the day   I feel her slowly chilling breath invade        The cheek grown thin the brown hair sprent with Hrey           I feel her finger light     Laid pausefully upon lifes headlong train          The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew         The heart less bounding at emotion new     And hope once crushd less quick to spring again And long the way appears which seemd so short     To the less practised eye of sanguine youth         And high the mountaintops in cloudy air     The mountaintops where is the throne of Truth         Tops in lifes morningsun so bright and bare             Unbreachable the fort  Of the longbatterd world uplifts its

That lone skypointing tree are not for him        To a boon southern country he is fled             And now in happier air     Wandering with the great Mothers train divine        And purer or more

flattering crew         Tis not in the worlds market bought and sold             But the smoothslipping weeks     Drop by and leave its seeker still untired         Out of the heed of mortals he is

gave thee nothing but this happy quest    If men esteemd thee feeble gave thee power         If men procured thee trouble gave thee rest             And this rude Cumner ground     Its firtopped Hurst its farms its quiet fields         Here camst thou in thy jocund youthful time       Here was thine height of strength thy golden prime     And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields What though the music of thy rustic flute     Kept not for long its happy country tone        Lost it too soon and learnt a stormy note    Of men contentiontost of men who groan         Which taskd thy pipe too sore and tired thy throat            It faild and thou wage mute     Yet hadst thou always visions of our light         And long with men of care thou couldst not stay        And soon thy foot resumed its

desire What Knight is this so weak and pale Though the locks are yet brown on his noble head Propt on pillows in his bed Gazing seaward for the light Of some ship that fights the gale On this wild December night Over the sick mans feet is spread A dark green forestdress A gold harp leans against the bed Ruddy in the fires light I know him by his harp of gold Famous in Arthurs court of old I know him by his forestdress The peerless hunter harper knight Tristram of Lyoness What Lady is this whose silk attire Gleams so rich in the light of the fire The ringlets on her shoulders lying In their flitting lustre vying With the clasp of burnishd gold Which her heavy robe doth hold Her looks are mild her fingers slight As the driven snow are white But her cheeks are sunk and pale Is it that the bleak seagale Beating from the Atlantic sea On this coast of Brittany Nips too keenly the sweet flower Is it that a deep fatigue Hath come on her a chilly fear Passing all her youthful hour Spinning with her maidens here Listlessly through the windowbars Gazing seawards many a league From her lonely shorebuilt tower While the knights are at the wars Or perhaps has her young heart Felt already some deeper smart Of those that in secret the heartstrings rive Leaving her sunk and pale though fair Who is this snowdrop by the sea I know her by her mildness rare Her snowwhite hands her

word without a tear Ah tis well he should retrace His tranquil life in this lone place His gentle bearing at the side Of his timid youthful bride His long rambles by the shore On winterevenings when the roar Of the near waves came sadly grand Through the dark up the drownd sand Or his endless reveries In the woods where the gleams play On the grass under the trees Passing the long summers day Idle as a mossy stone In the forestdepths alone The chase neglected and his hound Couchd beside him on the ground Ah what troubles on his brow Hither let him wander now Hither to the quiet hours Passd among these heaths of ours By the grey Atlantic sea Hours if not of ecstasy From violent anguish surely free Tristram All red with blood the whirling river flows The wide plain rings the dazed air throbs with blows Upon us are the chivalry of Rome Their spears are down their steeds are bathed in foam Up Tristram up men cry thou moonstruck knight What foul fiend rides thee On into the fight Above the din her voice is in my ears I see her form glide through the crossing spears Iseult Ah he wanders forth again We cannot keep him now as then Theres a secret in his breast Which will never let him rest These musing fits in the green wood They cloud the brain they dull the blood His sword is sharp his horse is good Beyond the mountains will he see The famous towns of Italy And label with the blessed sign The heathen Saxons on the Rhine At Arthurs side he fights once more With the Roman Emperor Theres many a gay knight where he goes Will help him to forget his care The march the leaguer Heavens blithe air The neighing steeds the ringing blows Sick pining comes not where these are Ah what boots it that the jest Lightens every other brow What that every other breast Dances as the trumpets blow If ones own heart beats not light On the waves of the tossd fight If oneself cannot get free From the clog of misery Thy lovely youthful wife grows pale Watching by the salt seatide With her children at her side For the gleam of thy white sail Home Tristram to thy halls again To our lonely sea complain To our forests tell thy pain Tristram All round the forest sweeps off black in shade But it is moonlight in the open glade And in the bottom of the glade shine clear The forestchapel and the fountain near I think I have a fever in my blood Come let me leave the shadow of this wood Ride down and bathe my hot brow in the flood Mild shines the cold spring in the moons clear light God tis her face plays in the waters bright Fair love she says canst thou forget so soon At this soft hour under this sweet moon Iseult Ah poor soul if this be so Only death can balm thy woe The solitudes of the green wood Had no medicine for thy mood The rushing battle cleard thy blood As little as did solitude Ah his eyelids slowly break Their hot seals and let him wake What new change shall we now see A happier Worse it cannot be Tristram Is my page here Come turn me to the fire Upon the windowpanes the moon shines bright The wind is downbut shell not come tonight Ah no she is asleep in Cornwall now Far hence her dreams are fairsmooth is her brow Of me she recks not nor my vain desire I have had dreams I have had dreams my page Would take a score years from a strong mans age And with a blood like mine will leave I fear Scant leisure for a second messenger My princess art thou there Sweet do not wait To bed and sleep my fever is gone by Tonight my page shall keep me company Where do the children sleep kiss them for me Poor child thou art almost as pale as I This comes of nursing long and watching late To bedgood night She left the gleamlit fireplace She came to the bedside She took his hands in hersher tears Down on his wasted fingers raind She raised her eyes upon his face Not with a look of wounded pride A look as if the heart complained Her look was like a sad embrace The gaze of one who can divine A grief and sympathise Sweet flower thy childrens eyes Are not more innocent than thine But they sleep in shelterd rest Like helpless birds in the warm nest On the castles southern side Where feebly comes the mournful roar Of buffeting wind and surging tide Through many a room and corridor Full on their window the moons ray Makes their chamber as bright as day It shines upon the blank white walls And on the snowy pillow falls And on two angelheads doth play Turnd to each otherthe eyes closed The lashes on the cheeks reposed Round each sweet brow the cap closeset Hardly lets peep the golden hair Through the softopend lips the air Scarcely moves the coverlet One little wandering arm is thrown At random on the counterpane And often the fingers close in haste As if their babyowner chased The butterflies again This stir they have and this alone But else they are so still Ah tired madcaps you lie still But were you at the window now To look forth on the fairy sight Of your illumined haunts by night To see the parkglades where you play Far lovelier than they are by day To see the sparkle on the eaves And upon every giantbough Of those old oaks whose wet red leaves Are jewelld with bright drops of rain How would your voices run again And far beyond the sparkling trees Of the castlepark one sees The bare heaths spreading clear as day Moor behind moor far far away Into the heart of Brittany And here and there lockd by the land Long inlets of smooth glittering sea And many a stretch of watery sand All shining in the white moonbeams But you see fairer in your dreams What voices are these on the clear nightair What lights in the courtwhat steps on the stair II ISEULT OF IRELAND Tristram Raise the light my page that I may see her Thou art come at last then haughty Queen Long Ive waited long Ive fought my fever Late thou comest

in courts believe me Love like mine is alterd in the breast Courtly life is light and cannot reach it Ah it lives because so deepsuppressd What thou thinkst men speak in courtly chambers Words by which the wretched are consoled What thou thinkst this aching brow was cooler Circled Tristram by a band of gold Royal state with Marc my deepwrongd husband That was bliss to make my sorrows flee Silken courtiers whispering honied nothings Those were friends to make me false to thee Ah on which if both our lots were balanced Was indeed the heaviest burden thrown Thee a pining exile in thy forest Me a smiling queen upon my throne Vain and strange debate where both have sufferd Both have passd a youth consumed and sad Both have brought their anxious day to evening And have now short space for being glad Joind we are henceforth nor will thy people Nor thy younger Iseult take it ill That a former rival shares her office When she sees her humbled pale and still I a faded watcher by

vain I feel my end approaching This is what my mother said should be When the fierce pains took her in the forest The deep draughts of death in bearing me Son she said thy name shall be of sorrow Tristram art thou calld for my deaths sake So she said and died in the drear forest Grief since then his home with me doth make I am dyingStart not nor look wildly Me thy living friend thou canst not save But since living we were ununited Go not far O Iseult from my grave Close mine eyes then seek the princess Iseult Speak her fair she is of royal blood Say I willd so that thou stay beside me She will grant it she is kind and good Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee One last kiss upon the living shore Iseult TristramTristramstayreceive me with thee Iseult leaves thee Tristram never more You see them clearthe moon shines bright Slow slow and softly where she stood She sinks upon the groundher hood Has fallen back her arms outspread Still hold her lovers hand her head Is bowd halfburied on the bed Oer the blanchd sheet her raven hair Lies in disorderd streams and there Strung like white stars the pearls still are And the golden bracelets heavy and rare Flash on her white arms still The very same which yesternight Flashd in the silver sconces light When the feast was gay and the laughter loud In Tyntagels palace proud But then they deckd a restless ghost With hotflushd cheeks and brilliant eyes And quivering lips on which the tide Of courtly speech abruptly died And a glance which over the crowded floor The dancers and the festive host Flew ever to the door That the knights eyed her in surprise And the dames whispered scoffingly Her moods good lack they pass like showers But yesternight and she would be As pale and still as witherd flowers And now tonight she laughs and speaks And has a colour in her cheeks Christ keep us from such fantasy Yes now the longing is oerpast Which doggd by fear and fought by shame Shook her weak bosom day and night Consumed her beauty like a flame And dimmd it like the desertblast And though the bedclothes hide her face Yet were it lifted to the light The sweet expression of her brow Would charm the gazer till his thought Erased the ravages of time Filld up the hollow cheek and brought A freshness back as of her prime So healing is her quiet now So perfectly the lines express A tranquil settled loveliness Her younger rivals purest grace The air of the Decembernight Steals coldly around the chamber bright Where those lifeless lovers be Swinging with it in the light Flaps the ghostlike tapestry And on the arras wrought you see A stately Huntsman clad in green And round him a fresh forestscene On that clear forestknoll he stays With his pack round him and delays He stares and stares with troubled face At this huge gleamlit fireplace At that bright ironfigured door And those blown rushes on the floor He gazes down into the room With heated cheeks and flurried air And to himself he seems to say What place is this and who are they Who is that kneeling Lady fair And on his pillows that pale Knight Who seems of marble on a tomb How comes it here this chamber bright Through whose mulliond windows clear The castlecourt all wet with rain The drawbridge and the moat appear And then the beach and markd with spray The sunken reefs and far away The unquiet bright Atlantic plain What has some glamour made me sleep And sent me with my dogs to sweep By night with boisterous buglepeal Through some old seaside knightly hall Not in the free green wood at all That Knights asleep and at her prayer That Lady by the bed doth kneel Then hush thou boisterous buglepeal The wild boar rustles in his lair The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air But lord and hounds keep rooted there Cheer cheer thy dogs into the brake O Hunter and without a fear Thy goldentasselld bugle blow And through the glades thy pastime take For thou wilt rouse no sleepers here For these thou seest are unmoved Cold cold as those who lived and loved A thousand years ago III ISEULT OF BRITTANY A year had flown and oer the sea away In Cornwall Tristram and Queen Iseult lay In King Marcs chapel in Tyntagel old There in a ship they bore those lovers cold The young surviving Iseult one bright day Had wanderd forth Her children were at play In a green circular hollow in the heath Which borders the seashorea country path Creeps over it from the tilld fields behind The hollows grassy banks are softinclined And to one standing on them far and near The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear Over the waste This cirque of open ground Is light and green the heather which all round Creeps thickly grows not here but the pale grass Is strewn with rocks and many a shiverd mass Of veind whitegleaming quartz and here and there Dotted with hollytrees and juniper In the smooth centre of the opening stood Three hollies side by side and made a screen Warm with the wintersun of burnishd green With scarlet berries gemmd the fellfares food Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands Watching her children play their little hands Are busy gathering spars of quartz and streams Of stagshorn for their hats anon with screams Of mad delight they drop their spoils and bound Among the hollyclumps and broken ground Racing full speed and startling in their rush The fellfares and the speckled misselthrush Out of their glossy covertsbut when now Their cheeks were flushd and over each hot brow Under the featherd hats of the sweet pair In blinding masses showerd the golden hair Then Iseult calld them to her and the three Clusterd under the hollyscreen and she Told them an oldworld Breton history Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there Under the hollies in the clear still air Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring Long they stayd stillthen pacing at their ease Moved up and down under the glossy trees But still as they pursued their warm dry road From Iseults lips the unbroken story flowd And still the children listend their blue eyes Fixd on their mothers face in wide surprise Nor did their looks stray once to the seaside Nor to the brown heaths round them bright and wide Nor to the snow which though twas all away From the open heath still by the hedgerows lay Nor to the shining seafowl that with screams Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams Swooping to landward nor to where quite clear The fellfares settled on the thickets near And they would still have listend till dark night Came keen and chill down on the heather bright But when the red glow on the sea grew cold And the grey turrets of the castle old Lookd sternly through the frosty eveningair Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair And brought her tale to an end and found the path And led them home over the darkening heath And is she happy Does she see unmoved The days in which she might have lived and loved Slip without bringing bliss slowly away One after one tomorrow like today Joy has not found her yet nor ever will Is it this thought which makes her mien so still Her features so fatigued her eyes though sweet So sunk so rarely lifted save to meet Her childrens She moves slow her voice alone Hath yet an infantine and silver tone But even that comes languidly in truth She seems one dying in a mask of youth And now she will go home and softly lay Her laughing children in their beds and play Awhile with them before they sleep and then Shell light her silver lamp which fishermen Dragging their nets through the rough waves afar Along this iron coast know like a star And take her broideryframe and there shell sit Hour after hour her gold curls sweeping it Lifting her softbent head only to mind Her children or to listen to the wind And when the clock peals midnight she will move Her work away and let her fingers rove Across the shaggy brows of Tristrams hound Who lies guarding her feet along the ground Or else she will fall musing her blue eyes Fixt her slight hands claspd on her lap then rise And at her priedieu kneel until she have told Her rosarybeads of ebony tippd with gold Then to her soft sleepand tomorrowll be Todays exact repeated effigy Yes it is lonely for her in her hall The children and the greyhaird seneschal Her women and Sir Tristrams aged hound Are there the sole companions to be found But these she loves and noiser life than this She would find ill to bear weak as she is She has her children too and night and day Is with them and the wide heaths where they play The hollies and the cliff and the seashore The sand the seabirds and the distant sails These are to her dear as to them the tales With which this day the children she beguiled She gleaned from Breton grandames when a child In every hut along this seacoast wild She herself loves them still and when they are told Can forget all to hear them as of old Dear saints it is not sorrow as I hear Not suffering which shuts up eye and ear To all that has delighted them before And lets us be what we were once no more No we may suffer deeply yet retain Power to be moved and soothed for all our pain By what of old pleased us and will again No tis the gradual furnace of the world In whose hot air our spirits are upcurld Until they crumble or else grow like steel Which kills in us the bloom the youth the spring Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel But takes away the powerthis can avail By drying up our joy in everything To make our former pleasures all seem stale This or some tyrannous single thought some fit Of passion which subdues our souls to it Till for its sake alone we live and move Call it ambition or remorse or love This too can change us wholly and make seem All which we did before shadow and dream And yet I swear it angers me to see How this fool passion gulls men potently Being in truth but a diseased unrest And an unnatural overheat at best How they are full of languor and distress Not having it which when they do possess They straightway are burnt up with fume and care And spend their lives in posting here and there Where this plague drives them and have little ease Are furious with themselves and hard to please Like that bold Csar the famed Roman wight Who wept at reading of a Grecian knight Who made a name at younger years than he Or that renownd mirror of chivalry Prince Alexander Philips peerless son Who carried the great war from Macedon Into the Soudans realm and thundered on To die at thirtyfive in Babylon What tale did Iseult to the children say Under the hollies that brightwinters day She told them of the fairyhaunted land Away the other side of Brittany Beyond the heaths edged by the lonely sea Of the deep forestglades of Broceliande Through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps Where Merlin by the enchanted thorntree sleeps For here he came with the fay Vivian One April when the warm days first began He was on foot and that false fay his friend On her white palfrey here he met his end In these lone sylvan glades that Aprilday This tale of Merlin and the lovely fay Was the one Iseult chose and she brought clear Before the childrens fancy him and her Blowing between the stems the forestair Had loosend the brown locks of Vivians hair Which playd on her flushd cheek and her blue eyes Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise Her palfreys flanks were mired and bathed in sweat For they had travelld far and not stoppd yet A brier in that tangled wilderness Had scored her white right hand which she allows To rest ungloved on her green ridingdress The other warded off the drooping boughs But still she chatted on with her blue eyes Fixd full on Merlins face her stately prize Her haviour had the mornings fresh clear grace The spirit of the woods was in her face She lookd so witching fair that learned wight Forgot his craft and his best wits took flight And he grew fond and eager to obey His mistress use her empire as she may They came to where the brushwood ceased and day Peerd twixt the stems and the ground broke away In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook And up as high as where they stood to look On the brooks farther side was clear but then The underwood and trees began again This open glen was studded thick with thorns Then white with blossom and you saw the horns Through last years fern of the shy fallowdeer Who come at noon down to the water here You saw the brighteyed squirrels dart along Under the thorns on the green sward and strong The blackbird whistled from the dingles near And the weird chipping of the woodpecker Rang lonelily and sharp the sky was fair And a fresh breath of spring stirrd everywhere Merlin and Vivian stoppd on the slopes brow To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough Which glistering plays all round them lone and mild As if to itself the quiet forest smiled Upon the browtop grew a thorn and here The grass was dry and mossd and you saw clear Across the hollow white anemones Starrd the cool turf and clumps of primroses Ran out from the dark underwood behind No fairer restingplace a man could find Here let us halt said Merlin then and she Nodded and tied her palfrey to a tree They sate them down together and a sleep Fell upon Merlin more like death so deep Her finger on her lips then Vivian rose And from her brownlockd head the wimple throws And takes it in her hand and waves it over The blossomd thorntree and her sleeping lover Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round And made a little plot of magic ground And in that daised circle as men say Is Merlin prisoner till the judgmentday But she herself whither she will can rove For she was passing weary of his love,b,Sad

       At the hand of Harendra Mukerji         Senior Gomashta GBT  Value Payable Parcels Post  in which the Government collects the moneyfor the sender Boh Da Thone was a warrior boldHis sword and his Snider were bossed with gold And the Peacock Banner his henchmen boreWas stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore He shot at the strong and he slashed at the weakFrom the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak He crucified noble he sacrificed meanHe filled old ladies with kerosene While over the water the papers criedThe patriot fights for his countryside But little they cared for the Native PressThe worn white soldiers in Khaki dress Who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byreWho died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire Who gave up their lives at the Queens CommandFor the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land Now first of the foemen of Boh Da ThoneWas Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone And his was a Company seventy strongWho hustled that dissolute Chief along There were lads from Galway and Louth and MeathWho went to their death with a joke in their teeth And worshipped with fluency fervour and zealThe mud on the bootheels of Crook ONeil But ever a blight on their labours layAnd ever their quarry would vanish away Till the sundried boys of the Black TyroneTook a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone And sooth if pursuit in possession endsThe Boh and his trackers were best of friends The word of a scout  a march by night A rush through the mist  a scattering fight  A volley from cover  a corpse in the clearing The glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring  The flare of a village  the tally of slain And  the Boh was abroad on the raid again They cursed their luck as the Irish willThey gave him credit for cunning and skill They buried their dead they bolted their beefAnd started anew on the track of the thief Till in place of the Kalends of Greece men saidWhen Crook and his darlings come back with the head They had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain He doubled and broke for the hills again They had crippled his power for rapine and raidThey had routed him out of his pet stockade And at last they came when the Day Star tiredTo a camp deserted  a village fired A black cross blistered the MorninggoldAnd the body upon it was stark and cold The wind of the dawn went merrily pastThe high grass bowed her plumes to the blast And out of the grass on a sudden brokeA spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke  And Captain ONeil of the Black TyroneWas blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone The gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone Now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwireIs a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire                      The shotwound festered  as shotwounds mayIn a steaming barrack at Mandalay The left arm throbbed and the Captain sworeId like to be after the Boh once more The fever held him  the Captain saidId give a hundred to look at his head The Hospital punkahs creaked and whirredBut Babu Harendra Gomashta heard He thought of the canebrake green and dankThat girdled his home by the Dacca tank He thought of his wife and his High School sonHe thought  but abandoned the thought  of a gun His sleep was broken by visions dreadOf a shining Boh with a silver head He kept his counsel and went his wayAnd swindled the cartmen of half their pay                      And the months went on as the worst must doAnd the Boh returned to the raid anew But the Captain had quitted the longdrawn strifeAnd in far Simoorie had taken a wife And she was a damsel of delicate mouldWith hair like the sunshine and heart of gold And little she knew the arms that embracedHad cloven a man from the brow to the waist And little she knew that the loving lipsHad ordered a quivering lifes eclipse And the eye that lit at her lightest breathHad glared unawed in the Gates of Death For these be matters a man would hideAs a general rule from an innocent Bride And little the Captain thought of the pastAnd of all men Babu Harendra last                      But slow in the sludge of the Kathun roadThe Government Bullock Train toted its load Speckless and spotless and shining with gheeIn the rearmost cart sat the Babujee And ever a phantom before him fledOf a scowling Boh with a silver head Then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slavedAnd the cartmen flogged and the escort raved And out of the jungle with yells and squealsPranced Boh Da Thone and his gang at his heels Then belching blunderbuss answered backThe Sniders snarl and the carbines crack And the blithe revolver began to singTo the blade that twanged on the lockingring And the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissedAs the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist And the great white bullocks with onyx eyesWatched the souls of the dead arise And over the smoke of the fusilladeThe Peacock Banner staggered and swayed Oh gayest of scrimmages man may seeIs a wellworked rush on the GBT The Babu shook at the horrible sightAnd girded his ponderous loins for flight But Fate had ordained that the Boh should startOn a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart And out of that cart with a bellow of woeThe Babu fell  flat on the top of the Boh For years had Harendra served the StateTo the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet There were twenty stone as the tallyman knowsOn the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs And twenty stone from a height dischargedAre bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged Oh short was the struggle  severe was the shock He dropped like a bullock  he lay like a block And the Babu above him convulsed with fearHeard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear And thus in a fashion undignifiedThe princely pest of the Chindwin died                      Turn now to Simoorie where lapped in his easeThe Captain is petting the Bride on his knees Where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans screamAre mixed as the mist of some devilish dream  Forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shamblesWhere the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols From the swordbelt set free and released from the steelThe Peace of the Lord is with Captain ONeil                      Up the hill to Simoorie  most patient of drudges The

aboveAs the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love From the arms of the Bride ironvisaged and slowThe Captain bent down to the Head of the Boh And een as he looked on the Thing where It layTwixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array The freed mind fled back to the longago days The handtohand scuffle  the smoke and the blaze  The forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn The banjo at twilight the burial ere morn  The stench of the marshes  the raw piercing smellWhen the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell  The oaths of his Irish that surged when they stoodWhere the black crosses hung oer the Kuttamow flood As a derelict ship drifts away with the tideThe Captain went out on the Past from his Bride Back back through the springs to the chill of the yearWhen he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer As the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep waterIn his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter And men who had fought with ONeil for the lifeHad gazed on his face with less dread than his wife For she who had held him so long could not hold him Though a fourmonth Eternity should have controlled him  But watched the twin Terror  the head turned to head The scowling scarred Black and the flushed savage Red  The spirit that changed from her knowing and flew toSome grim hidden Past she had never a clue to But It knew as It grinned for he touched it unfearingAnd muttered aloud So you kept that jade earring Then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friendOld man you fought well but you lost in the end                      The visions departed and Shame followed Passion He took what I said in this horrible fashion Ill write to Harendra  With language unsaintedThe Captain came back to the Bride  who had fainted                      And this is a fiction  No  Go to SimoorieAnd look at their baby a twelvemonth old Houri A pert little Irisheyed Kathleen Mavournin Shes always about on the Mall of a mornin  And youll see if her right

2041,The Ballad Of East And West Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet    Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat    But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth    When two strong men stand face to face      tho they come from the ends of the earth Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the BordersideAnd he has lifted the Colonels mare that is the Colonels prideHe has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the dayAnd turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far awayThen up and spoke the Colonels son that led a troop of the GuidesIs there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hidesThen up and spoke Mahommed Khan the son of the RessaldarIf ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets areAt dusk he harries the Abazai  at dawn he is into BonairBut he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fareSo if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can flyBy the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of JagaiBut if he be past the Tongue of Jagai right swiftly turn ye thenFor the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamals menThere is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn betweenAnd ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seenThe Colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was heWith the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the gallowstreeThe Colonels son to the Fort has won they bid him stay to eat Who rides at the tail of a Border thief he sits not long at his meatHes up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can flyTill he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the Tongue of JagaiTill he was aware of his fathers mare with Kamal upon her backAnd when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crackHe has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wideYe shoot like a soldier Kamal said  Show now if ye can rideIts up and over the Tongue of Jagai as blown dustdevils goThe dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doeThe dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head aboveBut the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a gloveThere was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn betweenAnd thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seenThey have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawnThe dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawnThe dun he fell at a watercourse  in a woful heap fell heAnd Kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider freeHe has knocked the pistol out of his hand  small room was there to striveTwas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long aliveThere was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of treeBut covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his kneeIf I had raised my bridlehand as I have held it lowThe little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a rowIf I had bowed my head on my breast as I have held it highThe kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not flyLightly answered the Colonels son  Do good to bird and beastBut count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feastIf there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones awayBelike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could payThey will feed their horse on the standing crop their men on the garnered grainThe thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slainBut if thou thinkest the price be fair  thy brethren wait to supThe hound is kin to the jackalspawn  howl dog and call them upAnd if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stackGive me my fathers mare again and Ill fight my own way backKamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feetNo talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meetMay I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breathWhat dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with DeathLightly answered the Colonels son  I hold by the blood of my clanTake up the mare for my fathers gift  by God she has carried a manThe red mare ran to the Colonels son and nuzzled against his breastWe be two strong men said Kamal then but she loveth the younger bestSo she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded reinMy broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twainThe Colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleendYe have taken the one from a foe said he will ye take the mate from a friendA gift for a gift said Kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limbThy father has sent his son to me Ill send my son to himWith that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in restNow here is thy master Kamal said who leads a troop of the GuidesAnd thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder ridesTill Death or I cut loose the tie at camp and board and bedThy life is his  thy fate it is to guard him with thy headSo thou must eat the White Queens meat and all her foes are thineAnd thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the BorderlineAnd thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur They have looked each other between the eyes and there they found no faultThey have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on leavened bread and saltThey have taken the Oath of the BrotherinBlood on fire and freshcut sodOn the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife and the Wondrous Names of GodThe Colonels son he rides the mare and Kamals boy the dunAnd two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but oneAnd when they drew to the QuarterGuard full twenty swords flew clear There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineerHa done ha done said the Colonels son Put up the steel at your sidesLast night ye had struck at a Border thief  tonight tis a man of the Guides     Oh East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet    Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat    But there is neither East nor West Border nor Breed nor Birth    When two strong men stand face to face      tho they come from the ends of the earth ,b,Fear

him high they have sought him lowThey have sought him over down and leaThey have found him by the milkwhite thornThat guards the gates o Faerie     Twas bent beneath and blue above     Their eyes were held that they might not see    The kine that grazed beneath the knowes     Oh they were the Queens o Faerie Now cease your song the King he saidOh cease your song and get you dightTo vow your vow and watch your armsFor I will dub you a belted knight For I will give you a horse o prideWi blazon and spur and page and squireWi keep and tail and seizin and lawAnd land to hold at your desire True Thomas smiled above his harpAnd turned his face to the naked skyWhere blown before the wastrel windThe thistledown she floated by I ha vowed my vow in another placeAnd bitter oath it was on meI ha watched my arms the leelong nightWhere fivescore fighting men would flee My lance is tipped o the hammered flameMy shield is beat o the moonlight coldAnd I won my spurs in the Middle WorldA thousand fathom beneath the mould And what should I make wi a horse o prideAnd what should I make wi a sword so brownBut spill the rings o the Gentle FolkAnd flyte my kin in the Fairy Town And what should I make wi blazon and beltWi keep and tail and seizin and feeAnd what should I do wi page and squireThat am a king in my own countrie For I send east and I send westAnd I send far as my will may fleeBy dawn and dusk and the drinking rainAnd syne my Sendings return to me They come wi news of the groanin earthThey come wi news o the roarin seaWi word of Spirit and Ghost and FleshAnd man thats mazed

For I make Honour wi muckle mouthAs I make Shame wi mincin feetTo sing wi the priests at the marketcrossOr run wi the dogs in the naked street And some they give me the good red goldAnd some they give me the white moneyAnd some they give me a clout o mealFor they be people o low degree And the song I sing for the counted goldThe same I sing for the white moneyBut best I sing for the clout o mealThat simple people given me The King cast down a silver groatA silver groat o Scots moneyIf I come wi a poor mans dole he saidTrue Thomas will ye harp to me Whenas I harp to the children smallThey press me close on either handAnd who are you True Thomas saidThat you should ride while they must stand Light down light down from your horse o prideI trow ye talk too loud and hieAnd I will make you a triple wordAnd syne if ye dare ye shall noble me He has lighted down from his horse o prideAnd set his back against the stoneNow guard you well True Thomas saidEre I rax your heart from your breastbone True Thomas played upon his harpThe fairy harp that couldna leeAnd the first least word the proud King heardIt harpit the salt tear out o his ee Oh I see the love that I lost long syneI touch the hope that I may not seeAnd all that I did o hidden shameLike little snakes they hiss at me The sun is lost at noon  at noonThe dread o doom has grippit meTrue Thomas hide me under your cloakGod wot Im little fit to dee     Twas bent beneath and blue above      Twas open field and running flood     Where hot on heath and dike and wall     The high sun warmed the adders brood Lie down lie down True Thomas saidThe God shall judge when all is doneBut I will bring you a better wordAnd lift the cloud that I laid on True Thomas played upon his harpThat birled and brattled to his handAnd the next least word True Thomas madeIt garred the King take horse and brand Oh I hear the tread o the fighting menI see the sun on splent and spearI mark the arrow outen the fernThat flies so low and sings so clear Advance my standards to that warAnd bid my good knights prick and rideThe gled shall watch as fierce a fightAs eer was fought on the Border side     Twas bent beneath and blue above     Twas nodding grass and naked sky    Where ringing up the wastrel wind     The eyas stooped upon the pie True Thomas sighed above his harpAnd turned the song on the midmost stringAnd the last least word True Thomas madeHe harpit his dead youth back to the King Now I am prince and I do wellTo love my love withouten fearTo walk wi man in fellowshipAnd breathe my horse behind the deer My hounds they bay unto the deathThe buck has couched beyond the burnMy love she waits at her windowTo wash my hands when I return For that I live am I contentOh I have seen my true loves eyesTo stand wi Adam in EdengladeAnd run in the woods o Paradise     Twas naked sky and nodding grass     Twas running flood and wastrel wind    Where checked against the open pass     The red deer belled to call the hind True Thomas laid his harp awayAnd louted low at the saddlesideHe has taken stirrup and hauden reinAnd set the King on his horse o pride Sleep ye or wake True Thomas saidThat sit so still that muse so longSleep ye or wake  till the latter sleepI trow yell not forget my song I ha harpit a shadow out o the sunTo stand before your face and cryI ha armed the earth beneath your heelAnd over your head I ha dusked the sky I ha harpit ye up to the throne o GodI ha harpit your midmost soul in threeI ha harpit ye down to the Hinges o HellAnd  ye  would  make  a Knight o me ,b,Sad

him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking darkI had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother sharkI had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oilAnd lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoilI had stripped his hide for my hammockside and tasselled his beard i the meshAnd spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened fleshI had hove him down by the mangroves brown where the mudreef sucks and drawsMoored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs clawsHe is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him

2227,The Rhyme Of The Three Sealers Away by the lands of the Japanee     Where the paper lanterns glow    And the crews of all the shipping drink     In the house of Blood Street Joe    At twilight when the landward breeze     Brings up the harbour noise    And ebb of Yokohama Bay     Swigs chattering through the buoys    In Ciscos Dewdrop DiningRooms     They tell the tale anew    Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight    When the Baltic ran from the Northern Light     And the Stralsund fought the two Now this is the Law of the Muscovite that he proves with shot and steelWhen ye come by his isles in the Smoky Sea ye must not take the sealWhere the gray sea goes nakedly between the weedhung shelvesAnd the little blue fox he is bred for his skin and the seal they breed for themselvesFor when the matkas seek the shore to drop their pups alandThe great manseal haul out of the sea aroaring band by bandAnd when the first September gales have slaked their ruttingwrathThe great manseal haul back to the sea and no man knows their pathThen dark they lie and stark they lie  rookery dune and floeAnd the Northern Lights come down o nights to dance with the houseless snowAnd God Who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floeHe hears the cry of the little kitfox and the wind along the snowBut since our women must walk gay and money buys their gearThe sealingboats they filch that way at hazard year by yearEnglish they be and Japanee that hang on the Brown Bears flankAnd some be Scot but the worst of the lot and the boldest thieves be Yank It was the sealer Northern Light to the Smoky Seas she boreWith a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the Russian flag at her foreBaltic Stralsund and Northern Light  oh they were birds of a feather Slipping away to the Smoky Seas three sealthieves togetherAnd at last she came to a sandy cove and the Baltic lay thereinBut her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skinThere were fifteen hundred skins abeach cool pelt and proper furWhen the Northern Light drove into the bight and the seamist drove with herThe Baltic called her men and weighed  she could not choose but run For a stovepipe seen through the closing mist it shows like a fourinch gunAnd loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and shipAnd lie for a rotting contraband on Vladivostock slipShe turned and dived in the seasmother as a rabbit dives in the whinsAnd the Northern Light sent up her boats to steal the stolen skinsThey had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clearWhen they were aware of a sloopofwar ghostwhite and very nearHer flag she showed and her guns she showed  three of them black abeamAnd a funnel white with the crusted salt but never a show of steam There was no time to man the brakes they knocked the shackle freeAnd the Northern Light stood out again goosewinged to open seaFor life it is that is worse than death by force of Russian lawTo work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jawThey had not run a mile from shore  they heard no shots behind When the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the windBluffed  raised out on a bluff said he for if my names Tom HallYou must set a thief to catch a thief  and a thief has caught us allBy every butt in Oregon and every spar in MaineThe hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben PaineHe has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar and faith he has faked her well But Id know the Stralsunds deckhouse yet from here to the booms o HellOh once we ha met at Baltimore and twice on Boston pierBut the sickest day for you Reuben Paine was the day that you came here The day that you came here my lad to scare us from our sealWith your funnel made o your painted cloth and your guns o rotten dealRing and blow for the Baltic now and head her back to the bayAnd well come into the game again  with a double deck to play They rang and blew the sealers call  the poaching cry of the sea And they raised the Baltic out of the mist and an angry ship was sheAnd blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay againTill they heard the creak of the Stralsunds boom and the clank of her mooring chainThey laid them down by bitt and boat their pistols in their beltsAnd  Will you fight for it Reuben Paine or will you share the pelts A dogtoothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine and bared his flenchingknifeYea skin for skin and all that he hath a man will give for his lifeBut Ive six thousand skins below and Yeddo Port to seeAnd theres never a law of God or man runs north of FiftyThreeSo go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fillAnd Ill be good to your seal this catch as many as I shall kill Answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gunbutt slidBut the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they didThe weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloakAnd the flamespurts pale ran down the rail as the sealingrifles spokeThe bullets bit on bend and butt the splinter slivered freeLittle they trust to sparrowdust that stop the seal in his seaThe thick smoke hung and would not shift leaden it lay and blueBut three were down on the Baltics deck and two of the Stralsunds crewAn armslength out and overside the banked fog held them boundBut as they heard or groan or word they fired at the soundFor one cried out on the Name of God and one to have him ceaseAnd the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peaceAnd one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgins NameAnd the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they cameAnd in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneathAnd each man drew his watchful breath slow taken tween the teeth Trigger and ear and eye acock knit brow and harddrawn lips Bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the shipsTill they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breathTill they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death The tides theyll go through Fundy Race but Ill go nevermoreAnd see the hogs from ebbtide mark turn scampering back to shoreNo more Ill see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock groundOr watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the SoundSorrow is me in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fallBut if theres law o God or man youll swing for it yet Tom HallTom Hall stood up by the quarterrail  Your words in your teeth said heTheres never a law of God or man runs north of FiftyThreeSo go in grace with Him to face and an illspent life behindAnd Ill be good to your widows Rube as many as I shall find A Stralsund man shot blind and large and a warlock Finn was heAnd he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a handsbreadth over the kneeTom Hall caught hold by the toppinglift and sat him down with an oathYoull wait a little Rube he said the Devil has called for bothThe Devil is driving both this tide and the killinggrounds are closeAnd well go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goesO men put back your guns again and lay your rifles byWeve fought our fight and the best are down  Let up and let us dieQuit firing by the bow there  quit  Call off the Baltics crewYoure sure of Hell as me or Rube  but wait till we get throughThere went no word between the ships but thick and quick and loudThe lifeblood drummed on the dripping decks with the fogdew from the shroudThe seapull drew them side by side gunnel to gunnel laidAnd they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear but never a word was said Then Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passedHave I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at lastCurse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind I have gotten my death where I got my bread but I dare not face it blindCurse on the fog  Is there never a wind of all the winds I knewTo clear the smother from off my chest and let me look at the blueThe good fog heard  like a splitten sail to left and right she toreAnd they saw the sundogs in the haze and the seal upon the shoreSilver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steelbacked tideAnd pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared oversideO rainbowgay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spreadAnd gold raw gold the spent shell rolled between the careless dead The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to leeAnd they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see And a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails liftBut no man stood by wheel or sheet and they let the schooners driftAnd the rattle rose in Reubens throat and he cast his soul with a cryAnd Gone already Tom Hall he said  Then its time for me to dieHis eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the landAnd he spoke as a man that talks in dreams his wound beneath his handOh there comes no good o the westering wind that backs against the sunWash down the decks  theyre all too red  and share the skins and runBaltic Stralsund and Northern Light  clean share and share for allYoull find the fleets off Tolstoi Mees but you will not find Tom HallEvil he did in shoalwater and blacker sin on the deepBut now hes sick of watch and trick and now hell turn and sleepHell have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer soBut hell lie down on the killinggrounds where the holluschickie goAnd west youll sail and south again beyond the seafogs rimAnd tell the Yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for himAnd youll not weight him by the heels and dump him oversideBut carry him up to the sandhollows to die as Bering diedAnd make a place for Reuben Paine that knows the fight was fairAnd leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there     Halfsteam ahead by guess and lead for the sun is mostly veiled     Through fog to fog by luck and log sail ye as Bering sailed    And if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain    North and by west from Zapne

showing how the Sickness ceasedBecause of her who died to save the tribe Taman is One and greater than us allTaman is One and greater than all GodsTaman is Two in One and rides the skyCurved like a stallions croup from dusk to dawnAnd drums upon it with his heels wherebyIs bred the neighing thunder in the hills This is Taman the God of all ErHebWho was before all Gods and made all GodsAnd presently will break the Gods he madeAnd step upon the Earth to govern menWho give him milkdry ewes and cheat his PriestsOr leave his shrine unlighted  as ErHebLeft it unlighted and forgot TamanWhen all the Valley followed after KyshAnd Yabosh little Gods but very wiseAnd from the sky Taman beheld their sin He sent the Sickness out upon the hillsThe Red Horse Sickness with the iron hoovesTo turn the Valley to Taman again And the Red Horse snuffed thrice into the windThe naked wind that had no fear of himAnd the Red Horse stamped thrice upon the snowThe naked snow that had no fear of himAnd the Red Horse went out across the rocksThe ringing rocks that had no fear of himAnd downward where the lean birch meets the snowAnd downward where the gray pine meets the birchAnd downward where the dwarf oak meets the pineTill at his feet our cuplike pastures lay That night the slow mists of the evening droppedDropped as a cloth upon a dead mans faceAnd weltered in the Valley bluishwhiteLike water very silent  spread abroadLike water very silent from the ShrineUnlighted of Taman to where the streamIs dammed to fill our cattletroughs  sent upWhite waves that rocked and heaved and then were stillTill all the Valley glittered like a marshBeneath the moonlight filled with sluggish mistKneedeep so that men waded as they walked That night the Red Horse grazed above the DamBeyond the cattletroughs  Men heard him feedAnd those that heard him sickened where they lay Thus came the Sickness to ErHeb and slewTen men strong men and of the women fourAnd the Red Horse went hillward with the dawnBut near the cattletroughs his hoofprints lay That night the slow mists of the evening droppedDropped as a cloth upon the dead but roseA little higher to a young girls heightTill all the Valley glittered like a lakeBeneath the moonlight filled with sluggish mist That night the Red Horse grazed beyond the DamA stonesthrow from the troughs  Men heard him feedAnd those that heard him sickened where they layThus came the Sickness to ErHeb and slewOf men a score and of the women eightAnd of the children two                          Because the roadTo Gorukh was a road of enemiesAnd AoSafai was blocked with early snowWe could not flee from out the Valley  DeathSmote at us in a slaughterpen and KyshWas mute as Yabosh though the goats were slainAnd the Red Horse grazed nightly by

voices in the houses of the dead Yabosh and Kysh avail not  If the HorseReach the Unlighted Shrine we surely dieYe have forgotten of all Gods the ChiefTaman  Here rolled the thunder through the HillsAnd Yabosh shook upon his pedestalYe have forgotten of all Gods the ChiefToo long  And all were dumb save one who criedOn Yabosh with the Sapphire twixt His kneesBut found no answer in the smoky roofAnd being smitten of the Sickness diedBefore the altar of the Sapphire Shrine Then said Bisesa  I am near to DeathAnd have the Wisdom of the Grave for giftTo bear me on the path my feet must treadIf there be wealth on earth then I am richFor Armod is the first of all ErHebIf there be beauty on the earth  her eyesDropped for a moment to the temple floor Ye know that I am fair  If there be loveYe know that love is mine  The Chief in WarThe Man of Sixty Spears broke from the pressAnd would have clasped her but the Priests withstoodSaying  She has a message from TamanThen said Bisesa  By my wealth and loveAnd beauty I am chosen of the GodTaman  Here rolled the thunder through the HillsAnd Kysh fell forward on the Mound of Skulls In darkness and before our Priests the maidBetween the altars cast her bracelets downTherewith the heavy earrings Armod madeWhen he was young out of the watergoldOf Gorukh  threw the breastplate thick with jadeUpon the turquoise anklets  put asideThe bands of silver on her brow and neckAnd as the trinkets tinkled on the stonesThe thunder of Taman lowed like a bull Then said Bisesa stretching out her handsAs one in darkness fearing Devils  HelpO Priests I am a woman very weakAnd who am I to know the will of GodsTaman hath called me  whither shall I goThe Chief in War the Man of Sixty SpearsHowled in his torment fettered by the PriestsBut dared not come to her to drag her forthAnd dared not lift his spear against the PriestsThen all men wept                    There was a Priest of KyshBent with a hundred winters hairless blindAnd taloned as the great SnowEagle isHis seat was nearest to the altarfiresAnd he was counted dumb among the PriestsBut whether Kysh decreed or from TamanThe impotent tongue found utterance we knowAs little as the bats beneath the eavesHe cried so that they heard who stood without To the Unlighted Shrine and crept asideInto the shadow of his fallen GodAnd whimpered and Bisesa went her way That night the slow mists of the evening droppedDropped as a cloth upon the dead and roseAbove the roofs and by the Unlighted ShrineLay as the slimy water of the troughsWhen murrain thins the cattle of ErHebAnd through the mist men heard the Red Horse feed In Armods house they burned Bisesas dowerAnd killed her black bull Tor and broke her wheelAnd loosed her hair as for the marriagefeastWith cries more loud than mourning for the dead Across the fields from Armods dwellingplaceWe heard Bisesa weeping where she passedTo seek the Unlighted Shrine the Red Horse neighedAnd followed her and on the rivermintHis hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears Out of the mists of evening as the starOf AoSafai climbs through the black snowblurTo show the Pass is clear Bisesa steppedUpon the great gray slope of mortised stoneThe Causeway of Taman  The Red Horse neighedBehind her to the Unlighted Shrine  then fledNorth to the Mountain where his stable lies They know who dared the anger of TamanAnd watched that night above the clinging mistsFar up the hill Bisesas passing in She set her hand upon the carven doorFouled by a myriad bats and black with timeWhereon is graved the Glory of TamanIn letters older than the AoSafaiAnd twice she turned aside and twice she weptCast down upon the threshold clamouringFor him she loved  the Man of Sixty SpearsAnd for her father  and the black bull TorHers and her pride  Yea twice she turned awayBefore the awful darkness of the doorAnd the great horror of the Wall of ManWhere Man is made the plaything of TamanAn Eyeless Face that waits above and laughs But the third time she cried and put her palmsAgainst the hewn stone leaves and prayed TamanTo spare ErHeb and take her life for price They know who watched the doors were rent apartAnd closed upon Bisesa and the rainBroke like a flood across the Valley washedThe mist away but louder than the rainThe thunder of Taman filled men with fear Some say that from the Unlighted Shrine she criedFor succour very pitifully thriceAnd others that she sang and had no fearAnd some that there was neither song nor cryBut only thunder and the lashing rain Howbeit in the morning men rose upPerplexed with horror crowding to the ShrineAnd when ErHeb was gathered at the doorsThe Priests made lamentation and passed inTo a strange Temple and a God they fearedBut knew not               From the crevices the

2315,Tomlinson Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley SquareAnd a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far awayTill he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the Milky WayTill he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and ceaseAnd they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keysStand up stand up now Tomlinson and answer loud and highThe good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so loneAnd the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed boneO I have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guideAnd well would he answer all for me if he were by my side For that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fairBut now ye wait at Heavens Gate and not in Berkeley SquareThough we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for youFor the race is run by one and one and never by two and twoThen Tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was thereFor the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bareThe Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knifeAnd Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in lifeThis I have read in a book he said and that was told to meAnd this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in MuscovyThe good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the pathAnd Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrathYe have read ye have heard ye have thought he said and the tale is yet to runBy the worth of the body that once ye had give answer  what ha ye doneThen Tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it boreFor the Darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and Heavens Gate before O this I have felt and this I have guessed and this I have heard men sayAnd this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway Ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack Ye have hampered Heavens GateTheres little room between the stars in idleness to prateO none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kinThrough borrowed deed to Gods good meed that lies so fair withinGet hence get hence to the Lord of Wrong for doom has yet to runAnd  the faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you Tomlinson                      The Spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fellTill they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of HellThe first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with painBut the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn againThey may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to markThey may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the Scorn of the Outer DarkThe Wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the boneAnd he yearned to the flare of HellGate there as the light of his own hearthstoneThe Devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drewBut he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him throughWot ye the price of good pitcoal that I must pay said heThat ye rank yoursel so fit for Hell and ask no leave of meI am all oersib to Adams breed that ye should give me scornFor I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was bornSit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and highThe harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to dieAnd Tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the nightThe belly of a tortured star bloodred in HellMouth lightAnd Tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feetThe frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in HellMouth heatO I had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fallAnd if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fairBut now ye wait at HellMouth Gate and not in Berkeley SquareThough we whistled your love from her bed tonight I trow she would not runFor the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by oneThe Wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knifeAnd Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life Once I ha laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the GraveAnd thrice I ha patted my God on the head that men might call me braveThe Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool Do ye think I would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick foolI see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye didThat I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a gridThen Tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little graceFor HellGate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked SpaceNay this I ha heard quo  Tomlinson and this was noised abroadAnd this I ha got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord Ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack and the tale begins afresh Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the fleshThen Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered Let me in For I mind that I borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sinThe Devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires highDid ye read of that sin in a book said he and Tomlinson said AyThe Devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ranAnd he said  Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a manWinnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worthTheres sore decline in Adams line if this be spawn of earthEmpusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fireBut weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desireOver the coal they chased the Soul and racked it all abroadAs children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoardAnd back they came with the tattered Thing as children after playAnd they said  The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean awayWe have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering windAnd many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot findWe have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the boneAnd sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his ownThe Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low Im all oersib to Adams breed that I should bid him goYet close we lie and deep we lie and if I gave him placeMy gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my faceTheyd call my house a common stews and me a careless hostAnd  I would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghostThe Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flameAnd he thought of Holy Charity but he thought of his own good name Now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fryDid ye think of that theft for yourself said he and Tomlinson said AyThe Devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care Ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said but the roots of sin are thereAnd for that sin should ye come in were I the lord aloneBut sinful pride has rule inside  and mightier than my ownHonour and Wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whoreNay scarce I dare myself go there and you theyd torture soreYe are neither spirit nor spirk he said ye are neither book nor brute Go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Mans reputeIm all oersib to Adams breed that I should mock your painBut look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back againGet hence the hearse is at your door  the grim black stallions wait They bear your clay to place today  Speed lest ye come too lateGo back to Earth with a lip unsealed  go back with an open eyeAnd carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to dieThat the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one And  the God that you took from a printed book be with you Tomlinson ,b,Fear

2331,With Scindia To Delhi More than a hundred years ago in a great battle fought near Delhi    an Indian Prince rode fifty miles after the day was lost    with a beggargirl who had loved him and followed him in all his camps    on his saddlebow  He lost the girl when almost within sight of safety    A Maratta trooper tells the story   The wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neckOur hands and scarfs were saffrondyed for signal of despairWhen we went forth to Paniput to battle with the Mlech Ere we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there Thrice thirty thousand men were we to force the Jumna fords The hawkwinged horse of Damajee mailed squadrons of the BhaoStark levies of the southern hills the Deccans sharpest swordsAnd he the harlots traitor son the goatherd Mulhar Rao Thrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had clearedThe low white mists of morning heard the warconch scream and brayWe called upon Bhowani and we gripped them by the beardWe rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away The children of the hills of Khost before our lances ranWe drove the black Rohillas back as cattle to the penTwas then we needed Mulhar Rao to end what we beganA thousand men had saved the charge he fled the field with ten There was no room to clear a sword  no power to strike a blowFor foot to foot ay breast to breast the battle held us fast Save where the naked hillmen ran and stabbing from belowBrought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed To left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood To right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade Above the dark Upsaras flew beneath us plashed the bloodAnd bellying black against the dust the Bhagwa Jhanda swayed  The Choosers of the Slain I saw it fall in smoke and fire the banner of the BhaoI heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain Ho Anand Rao Nimbalkhur ride  Get aid of Mulhar RaoGo shame his squadrons into fight  the Bhao  the Bhao is slain Thereat as when a sandbar breaks in clotted spume and spray When rain of later autumn sweeps the Jumna waterheadBefore their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave wayBut of the waters of that flood the Jumna fords ran red I held by Scindia my lord as close as man might holdA Soobah of the Deccan asks no aid to guard his lifeBut Holkars Horse were flying and our chiefest chiefs were coldAnd like a flame among us leapt the long lean Northern knife I held by Scindia  my lance from butt to tuft was dyedThe froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridlechain What time beneath our horses feet a maiden rose and criedAnd clung to Scindia and I turned a swordcut from the twain He set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long agoA hunter by the Tapti banks she gave him water thereHe turned her heart to water and she followed to her woeWhat need had he of Lalun who had twenty maids as fair Now in that hour strength left my lord he wrenched his mare asideHe bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled freeAcross the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows rideFrom Paniput to Delhi town but not alone were we Twas LutufUllah Populzai laid horse upon our trackA swinefed reiver of the North that lusted for the maidI might have barred his path awhile but Scindia called me backAnd  I  O woe for Scindia  I listened and obeyed League after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by League after league the white road swirled behind the white mares feet League after league when leagues were done we heard the PopulzaiWhere sure as Time and swift as Death the tireless footfall beat Noons eye beheld that shame of flight the shadows fell we fledWhere steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our trainThe black wolf warred where we had warred the jackal mocked our deadAnd terror born of twilighttide made mad the labouring brain I gasped  A kingdom waits my lord her love is but her ownA day shall mar a day shall cure for her but what for theeCut loose the girl  he follows fast  Cut loose and ride aloneThen Scindia twixt his blistered lips  My Queens Queen shall she be Of all who ate my bread last night twas she alone that cameTo seek her love between the spears and find her crown thereinOne shame is mine today what need the weight of double shameIf once we reach the Delhi gate though all be lost I win We rode  the white mare failed  her trot a staggering stumble grew The cookingsmoke of even rose and weltered and hung lowAnd still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anewAnd Delhi town was very near but nearer was the foe Yea Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered  SlayLord of my life the mare sinks fast  stab deep and let me dieBut Scindia would not and the maid tore free and flung awayAnd turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai Then Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breathAnd wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a handsbreadth in her side The hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death The blood had chilled about her heart she reared and fell and died Our Gods were kind  Before he heard the maidens piteous screamA log upon the Delhi road beneath the mare he lay Lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dreamThe darkness closed about his eyes  I bore my King away ,b,Sad
